ANMATY0L0HX6Y,3998899561,Sasha Malkin,"[12, 16]","Unlike Most of the Rechargeable Battery cases, PowerBear Lasts up to 2 whole days. It doesn't heat up like most of the other ones, and I was completely fascinated by the ultra light and sleek design for the case. Before I was using the Mophie case but I couldn't wear it often because it was like having a hot brick in your pocket, Hence I had to always leave it at home.On the contrary, with PowerBear, I never take it off because I can't even tell the difference. Also it is build in a super STRONG manner and even though I dropped my phone a few times, its shock resistant technology won't let a single thing happen to the case or the phone. The PowerBear case became an extension to my phone that I never have to take off because when I charge it at night, it charges both my phone and the case, and I have battery life for more than two days. I was also shocked to hear all the positive compliments I was hearing from people at my job, fitness center, and throughout the community. Everybody was loving the case, and what they don't know is that it cost  me 60 % CHEAPER then all the other brand. This is the best purchase I've made on the internet, and I am going to buy more for my family in time for the Holidays.

A5A4374R8I7NB,6073894996,PWB Esq,"[1, 1]","I could only give this USB car charger 2 stars because although it worked fine for about 3 months, it subsequently died on me.Pros:-Has 2 USB ports for charging, one (the top) is 2.1 amps.  The bottom slot is lower, presumably 1 or 1.5 amps.-Fits well in my charging socket - holds tight.  I've had some that were loose in my charging socket.-Works well to charge my iPhone in the top slot and the bottom slot works with most Android phones, except the very high end ones.-Has a blue LED light to tell you it is on and ready to charge.-The USB sockets seem to be well made and tightly fit all my cables.-Pretty solid construction.-It cost less than $2.Cons:-It died on me after 3 months.I had really enjoyed using this USB charger.  It rapidly charged my iPhone and worked well with charging the phones of my family and friends.  The two slot design makes this design very handy; with a 1 slot design, no one else can charge their device unless I remove my cord.  Of course, after this charger died, I had to go back to the 1 slot design I was using before.After 3 months, I began to notice the LED light flickering.  It was less than a week later that is quit working permanently.  I'm not sure what the problem was - faulty wiring, bad design, I guess I'll never know.  I thought about getting another since they are so cheap, but then I thought better of it.  Maybe they are so cheap because they are simply disposable after a short period of time.For whatever reason, it died and I was forced to look for another 2 slot design - I haven't found one in my price range yet.",2,"Works Fine, But It Died On ME",1340582400,"06 25, 2012"

That extra length may be a bonus for most, but I bumped down the rating due to seller's lack of description and/or consistency.

I was expecting a square shape with the USB port on the side; I got the longer rectangle shape with the USB port on the end... hmm.

TPU (the plastic material where the case is made of) virtually resists oil and dust. I used to have an Otter box for my other phone. The protection is excellent BUT the silicone attracts dust like crazy. The S-Style pattern at the back is more of a personal taste - some people like it but some other may not. To me it adds some flavor to an otherwise plain black case. The protection on all 4 sides on the front panel looks sufficient (anyone dare to slam your phone on the floor to test it out?).

Phone companies just got cheap and decided to stop sending phones with a power cable AND a data cable separately, but in the end, you will go out and get yourself a standard power cable...like this one, which is just fine...quality-wise and price-wise.

I realize now that the company is selling several different items under the same listing, so the reviews can be confusing and not accurate.Like many other &#34;power users&#34; (i.e. slaves) of their iPhones, I came to the end of the usefulness for my iPhone 5's internal battery. After lamenting on whether or not to buy some of the cheaper options available, I went with the &#34;you get what you pay for&#34; cliche and paid for the extra assurance that I was not getting a cheap knockoff.The battery I received had a manufacturer date only a few months from when I ordered the piece. Who knows how accurate that is, but if you're taking it at face value, I find certain comfort knowing that my battery hasn't been sitting on the shelf losing it's potential usefulness in holding a charge for my crushing of candies.After successfully opening my phone, I can confirm that all the labeling and signage match exactly to what is on the original battery in my phone. Any copycat can do this, but it gives me hope that this new battery comes from the same manufacturers as the OEM battery.The tools worked just fine for me. I was able to pry the top glass of my phone off by using the tools provided in the kit. Do some extra research around properly removing the battery. Use the clear plastic sheet under the battery to help lift it up and separate from the adhesive. That was the most challenging part of my battery replacement.

This particular model, the EarBoom, is not with it's faults.  However, it will meet your needs for the most part if you figure out it's peculiarities.Jabra provides multiple ear gels for comfort and for left ear or right ear use.  The criticism that they are hard to get used to is valid.  You have to try putting them in different ways till you figure it out.  The instructions are not a substitute for trial and error I suppose.As for the hands-free jack on your phone, you have to make sure you have a 2.5 millimeter jack.  That is the one with 2 stripes on the plug.  Unfortunately, a specific compatibility list is hard to come by.  Look at the specs for your phone and give it a try.The microphone will capture sound just fine, despite the short arm.  If you find people are telling you your voice is muffled, you must slighly twist the microphone head.  I have found that sometimes, if it is at the wrong angle, it will not capture sound as well.  The arm is flexible enough that it can be adjusted slightly.I also prefer the EarWave Boom or the EarWrap, which have wraparound ear attachments and a slightly longer more solid arm.  The Jabra EarWave Bud doesn't have a microphone arm, but instead has the small mic on the cable with a clip to attach it to your tie.  Personally I don't like those models.  I have not found much difference in sound quality, though the EarWave Boom and the EarWrap are somehow easier to figure out.For difficulty of use and for a microphone arm style that I just don't like, I have docked this unit 2 stars.  It should be noted that none of Jabra's newer models have this microphone arm any longer  But this is good bang for the buck.

Penny's feedback on 10/26/05 about the ""skip"" mode as following:""One thing to keep in mind when using any product like this - some (but not all) car tape players have a ""skip"" mode. When a tape player's ""skip"" mode is active, it listens for silent portions of the tape. If it is detects any silence for more than a few seconds, it will automatically go into fast forward until it ""hears"" sound again. If your tape player has a ""skip"" mode, be sure to cancel this mode - i.e., put the player in ""normal"" play mode. Otherwise, you will find the tape player trying to ""fast forward"" over any silent portions of your audio feed.""This is exactly the problem that I was having.

This one works fantastic for the price. Sound quality is fine, about what you would expect from a cassette tape. The cord can be adjusted to travel from the adapter horizontally or vertically, which is great depending on your tape deck.The only negative I found was that after a few weeks of use, it stopped working properly. My car's tape deck is an auto-reverse deck, and I have no idea why it worked perfectly for weeks, then shut down on me and stopped, but if you look at J Cristofferson's review, there are tons of comments on how to fix this. I used these instructions to open the cassette (Carefully, lifting the two screw side so as not to lose all the pieces), and removed the tape reverse assembly. Then, as stated in that review, remove the metal screw that holds in the white gear without the black band around it, putting the screw and spring back on without that single gear. Put everyhting back together, and like magic, the cassette works perfectly now, even in my auto-reverse deck.I only wish that it came designed to do this without modifying it, but trust me, opening up the tape and fixing this is so simple. Takes about 5 minutes, and I have no experience with this kind of thing whatsoever, so if I can do it, you can do it!",4,"Great, and Easy to mod if your tape deck is auto-reverse",1301961600,"04 5, 2011"

Most players you need to insert the cassette sideways, but I had some players before that you need to insert the cassette lengthwise. You will never go wrong with this adapter as you can feed it to your cassette player both ways.- Does not look cheap. It looks more decent than other cassette adapters I have that costs 20$- The coiled cord is great and much less clutter.  I had a cassette adapter that has a cord that was too long, it got caught under the seat and the only way to remove it is to cut it.- Sounds good too with my Ipod.Cons:- The only thing I can think of is it still makes noticeable clicking sound while in the cassette.Bought this item twice already.",4,Just works!

It'll get stuck in this infinite loop. You have to take it out, smack it a few times to free up the wheels and then put it back in.

The pictures come out real clear and beautiful after you send it via Email. Please don't judge the quality of the pictures by what you see on the T610. I admit that the pictures look a little fuzzy on the T610. But with only 2MB of memory the purpose of taking pictures is to upload them or send them via Email to others. The quality of the pictures improves dramatically once they are sent and viewed via one's PC.2) The Bluetooth features on this phone are outrageous. I have paired my SE T610 using T-Mobile's unlimited VPN GPRS Data Service with my Palm Zire 72, HP IPAQ 4155, and Logitech Mobile Wireless Bluetooth Headset and Performance is Great. If you got a Bluetooth enabled Palm or Pocket PC, then this is the phone for you. Sony Ericsson was in on the ground floor on this Bluetooth Revolution. I send data via my Pocket PC and Palm to my SE T610 via Bluetooth in a flash. Moreover, web surfing is much faster than I thought via Bluetooth.3) I have absolutely NO problem with signal strength or clarity of voice calls in NYC where I primarily use this phone. Where I go in the boroughs of Queens, Bronx, Manhatten, Brooklyn and Nassau County (with the exception of Garden City) is great.People need to realize that T-Mobile does not have the extensive network that Verizon or even Sprint has. So, if you are looking to buy this phone to use with the T-Mobile Network, I can enthusiastically recommend it if you live in most of NYC (outside of Staten Island).

Sometimes quite painfully.I have a dull voice and this is by far the best headset I have that helps people hear me clearly (I actually have an older version of the same headset, so I have two). No one complains they can't hear me or do they need to turn up their volume. Noise cancellation is also pretty good. Not as good as my cheap jawbone, but then people usually complain they can't hear me as well on that one. So, stay away from this if you plan to talk on the phone a while or have larger ears.

(Ever since I got a large benign osteoma in my skull after, suspiciously, 6 months of very heavy cell phone use, I'm a bit paranoid about cell phone radiation).The jack is the smaller size (2.5 mm), which is unfortunate, as most smartphones these days are 3.5mm (so you can plug in a headset or just headphones).

A3H3SG8XIXVKXZ,B0000ALPBP,Science Aardvark,"[1, 1]","I got a pair of Plantronics-branded headsets in Verizon OEM packaging (plastic bag), each coming with a ""universal"" adapter (micro-USB male to 2.5mm female). The price was substantially the same (per unit). But there is a small issue--there are two sets of pictures on this product that represent two different units. The two on the right, with the plastic bag that is clearly labeled MX150xxxx are identical to what I have. Note the obvious button showing through the plastic (this one mutes, turns off the call or voice-dials on my Blackberry, but it may do other things on other models). However, the other photos show the same headset, but without the control button--not a different button, but nothing at all! This made me wonder what is being sold as MX150. The other issue is color. It's not clear if you get the black or a gray one or even if there is a choice. From the photo, one would assume that this dealer supply the gray ones, but I am not so sure. This is not exactly an item one buys for style points (it's compact, but looks bulky on the face), so it's a minor point, but it would be good to have some clarity.But, as far as the product itself goes, it's perfectly functional for the purpose--cheap branded headset (for me, specifically to complement a BT set, which this one replaces when charge runs out). I've had a number of cheap or free headsets (often even enclosed with a phone) and virtually all of them have awful raspy and tinny sound. That's not what I want in a headset, even for $3. But I needed an emergency headset and this one fit the bill. The sound quality is far superior to no-name headsets--on both ends. It's better than an average Sony/Ericsson handset--I always add a headset to those when using them since Sony deliberately puts crappy speakers into Ericsson phones to make you buy their headsets. When traveling through NY or DE or any other state that requires no-hands on the phone, it is essential to be quickly disconnect and replace a discharged BT headset. I have no qualms about using this one.UPDATE (9 months later): I got another of these sets for a friend but, although it fit, the phone rejected it as not compatible. It was a cheap ATT/Nokia handset to replace a lost phone so I am not surprised about compatibility issues. But that also meant that I got an extra set. About a month ago, one of the sets died when the phone got yanked too hard (probably a loose contact). At less than $2 each, I had no problem tossing it and pulling out the next one (and I still have two more left, having spent a total of $6, including shipping).

I was on the phone every day and for 6 hours or more on a rough day.I got tired of holding a phone to my ear in the office for hours and being 50 feet away from my desk and missing the important call I was waiting for. This device solved both problems.  The headset unit gives you call answer and end control with your fingertips as well as volume and mute control.  It gave me remote ring detection and allowed me to be up to 300 feet away from my desk and catch that important call.  It would operate for up to 8 hours but it has a desktop control stand that charged the headset while I am in a meeting or at lunch.I used the Plantronics HL 10 Handset Lifter and by touching the button on the headset I could answer the phone remotely with ease.  The sound going both ways was excellent and I never had an issue with the unit.  Other designs I had tried were not always clear and people would complain that they could not hear me.

The noise cancelling mike and the cushioned ear piece made for excellent communication and comfortable wearing for long hours during the day.The unit has a fast recharge time in about 3 hours for 100 % full charge from empty.

I am giving it 4 stars for:-simple set up-great sound quality-solid talk and standby time-comfortable, with a variety of wearing options-durability (still serves its purpose after 5+ years)I am taking away 1 star for 2 reasons:-Over the course of several years, the charger has gotten finicky.  If I don't place the headset in just right, and jiggle it a little to make sure it has a good connection, it doesn't charge.  Not a tremeendous problem except for those rare occassions when I forget to double check when I put it in the charger, and I end up with a dead headset.-There is a very noticeable buzz in the line if you use the phone handset, which means you MUST use the headset.  I've looked at set up, but there is really only one way to connect the wires, so I don't believe there is way to avoid this.  The simple solution is to just always use the headset, which is fine, but......on those occassions where the headset is dead (see above), you're left with no great option.  When that happens, I end up having to use the speakerphone on my phone until the headset is charged again.  Not a really big deal, but then I get people asking ""talk me off speaker phone"", and I have to explain to them that I can't.Since this model is older, the 2 negatives above may have been fixed in more recent models.  Since this unit is still for sale, and apparently people are still buying it, I though I would just write this quick review.One thing to keep in mind.....know what you are getting with this.  If you have a typical desk phone, then you will need to physically lift the handset to answer calls, and physically lower the handset to end calls.  You can get a remote lifter that does the lifting for you, but I've never had one, so I can't comment on them.  I've heard mixed reviews about the remote lifters, but do your own research.  Regardless, just know that for a typical desk phone (i.e. one that is used in a home office, with the phone line going into the phone),  You can't just tap to talk or tap to end the call.  Somebody or something has to raise and lower the handset.  If you have a ""soft phone"" (calls over the inernet), or are in an office environment with a PBX type system, I can't comment.

The first problem I had was one of the latches came off immediately upon receipt of the item while trying to open it for the first time. One is easy to open but the other sticks so it requires some extra force to open. The latches are apparently designed to be removable so I was able to just slide it back in place but since it is so hard to unlatch I have pulled it totally off on three occasions now. I could just glue it in place but the fact that it is removable makes me wonder if the manufacturer is planning on it breaking eventually. Why else would it be designed so it can be easily removed?The second problem I had came after flying with it. There is no pressure release valve on it and after getting to my hotel I attempted to open this case and could not. I had to use a pocket knife to pry it open which is fine when I am on the ground but not so fine when I am on a plane where I am not allowed to have a knife. Upon returning home after another flight I was able to get the case open without my knife but it was not very easy. Since I bought it to keep some battery backups in for long flights it I don't think it will work for my needs.Edited to Add: So far I have not had any issues opening the box while on a plane. I still have problems after I land as sometimes it need to be pried open but at least while in the air it opens fine.

Problems the phone has that I find to be a real problem: 1. The battery life is the worst of any phone I've ever owned. It MAY last 2 to 3 days in stand by IF I don't use it at all; if I use the phone at all, even just 10 minutes, no more than one day on a full charge. 2. No voice activated dialing. I like to use a speaker type hands free kit in the car so I don't have to look at the phone to answer, talk or dial. I think all phones should have it. 3. It is not very user friendly. The menus are not logical and are confusing. 4. It has an IR but it doesn't sync with your computer. You can't transfer anything. I don't get why they even have it. They have software and cable you can purchase that will let you backup the phone numbers you enter and photos you take, but (5) no syncing with Outlook, your PDA or anything else. 6. If you buy ring tones or wallpaper, you can't back those up.I do love the phone for its size, weight and even the color, I find it easy to hold and talk with. The sound isn't the best, but it isn't bad either. It rings nice and loud and putting it on vibrate is easy. I can't put the phone in a standard cell phone holder for the car because the camera button is on the side and it's a long key, the holder makes the camera come on. I had to get a small holder that only grabs in one small area on each side. I've had to purchased 3 additional batteries and every kind of charger available because the average use of a battery is 15 hours (regular phone use for me is: about 10 minutes a day, use the &quot;t-zones&quot; for a minute or two once a month, in 6 months I've taken a total of 9 photos, and transferred data twice). The battery lasted 3 days ONCE, when I was home sick and didn't use the phone and one 24 hour day I had to replace the battery three times as they completely discharged. I'm use to a battery lasting 5 to 8 days (like this phone says it will last).I also like T-Mobile.

I've checked out all of the online support forums for this phone and I have not heard from anyone who has actually done this.

FYI to people with battery problems, with these kind of batteries, you must let it drain completely and then charge it.. kind of like building up your battery life and doing this a few times, it will improve your battery life immensely. I've been a T-Mobile customer for a while now and I stay with them because: 1) They are now no. 1 in customer service, 2) Great rate plans, 3) It works great where I need it the most!Now the additional features that the V205 didn't have that this little gadget has is:1) Caller ID pics.. although you won't be able to see it on the external display, when you flip it open, you'll see that person's face.2) The camera now has a flash as well as a zoom. And with that, it is able to take pictures in gray (black and white), negative, sepia, and sketch. Also, you can do multi-shot with this as well as put lots of different kind of frames to your pictures.3)You can download games with the E715 whereas you cannot do so with the v205. Furthermore, the games are actually java with E7154) The flash can also serve as a flashlight. Which is quite useful sometimes when you don't know where you're walking and the light is pretty bright.5) Voice memo.. nuf saidOtherwise, it has the usual features. It has an alarm, calculator, calendar, to do list, MMS, SMS, you can download ringtones (which is a big help since some of the ringtones sound pretty crappy), as well as games and pictures.

Also, the pictures that you can take by lookin at the external display will be a bluish-green color but when it's saved, and you look at it, it's in full color so no worries there.Overall, I have enjoyed this phone and no problems with it really.

A friend recommended Nextel, saying we'd use the direct connect function.  Cool.  So I ordered an i730 from Amazon.  After charging and activating and waiting the required day, I called to get my phone number.  It was a Palo Alto, CA, number!?  That's over 700 miles away!  An 11 hour drive to the next state.  No way close to a local number.  Nextel did not seem to understand or care.  &quot;It's the closest we have.&quot;  &quot;There are no 602 area code phone numbers left.&quot;  I begged for maybe a 480 number or anything that is a local call from here in Phoenix.  Nothing doing.  After a few more days and a few more calls to Nextel that went nowhere, I called Sprint (who have not been customer service stars to me in the past) and within four minutes had a local 602 Phoenix number working on my current Sprint phone.  I canceled the Nextel service.  They are charging me $35 (expected) plus $11.53 in taxes, fees and assessments &quot;we can't change&quot; for a couple of days when all I called was customer service.If you buy the phone, I hope Nextel has a local area code for you, because if they don't you are stuck for $46.53 and an Amazon return.

The phone doesn't squeak when squeezed, and all of the construction is tight (even the flip screen doesn't wiggle much).  I saw a few complaints about the weight of the phone, and even a complaint about the metal battery panel.  It's called quality, sometimes quality weighs a little, and if the phone makes your pants fall down when it's hooked onto your jeans, buy a belt.  The phone employs java applications, so you can download programs to fit your needs from nextel, at a cost.  You can also get them from third party sites, also ringtones, wallpaper, etc.  The phone uses GPS, can locate your approximate position for free, with software it can give you directions from one location to another for free (navigational software), called telenav.  The quality of the speakers and microphones on this phone is great.  The speakers can be loud enough to hear in different rooms of the house, or quiet enough you can barely hear them.  The sound is crisp, even on direct connect.  Also, an answer to the slams against nextel itself, don't listen to it.  The only problem is their tech support does not operate 24/7,  other than that their customer service is as good as any service based organization I've ever worked with.

I have many friends who own this phone though, although a few of them have since ""downgraded"" to the i710.The main reason I chose the i710 over this i730 was signal strength. the i710 consistently gets better signal the the i730 no matter which of my friends phones I compare it too. All my friends are on the same wireless plan from Nextel as I am, so I know its not service, it is definitely the phones.I can have full bars on my phone (5 including the little antennae icon) and my friends phone held right next to mine will have 2 or 3 bars.

Well I have 4 friends who have the i730, 5 friends with the i710 and one with the i860, all from Nextel, and the i710's always have better signal compared to the i730's. The i860 gets as good a signal as the i710 (but its significantly more expensive too).I am not sure why two phones based on the same hardware and software have such drastic differences in signal. The only thing I can think of is some hardware added to give the i730 an external screen somehow interferes with the antennae hardware somehow.Other than signal strength compared to the cheaper and basically identical (except for external screen) i710, the i730 is a pretty good phone.

No, not my mistake - checked this several times, and then spoke to a sales rep who said that this does indeed occur with this phone.4) Poor reception - the said Samsung had a much better reception in buildings.

Navigation of this phone was a breath of fresh air!  i will say I preferred how the phone book was layed out better in the S105, but everything else is easier to use on this phone and the T-Zones is so much more functional!

Clarity is a tad better in the S105, but nothing worth chosing that over this.  If there is even the slightest background noise, they sound the same.  The S105 and this are almost identical in size, but the E105 was smaller... not a bid deal to me.Bottom line: If you are a prude about clarity and size, go with E105.

Almost lasts a week with minimal usage; 2 days with heavier use.-Battery meter is very inaccurate below 1/2 charge.  Seems chronic with Motorola phones.-Nice, clear display.  A bit hard to see in the brightest sunlight, but other than that, no problems.-Camera is of average quality at best.  Takes okay pictures for a new wallpaper, but that's about it.-Serious annoyance: One of the side buttons that remain exposed when the phone is closed controls the type of ring/vibrate.  It's very loud if you don't already have the phone on silent/vibrate only.  Basically, to quickly change to phone from a loud ring to silent--say in a theater--you have to make a loud noise.  Very short sighted.  And since the button is exposed even with the phone closed, you end up hitting it by accident quite a bit.Overall, I'm pretty happy with the phone.

I have had the phone for two weeks now and I have been very pleased.  The reception is a bit tinny sometimes, but overall I have not had any problems with dropped calls.I text message quite frequently and the phone offers you two choices for writing your text.  The first is an intuitive text entry method where the phone guesses the words that you are trying to type and displays them on the screen for you to choose.  This method is supposed to save time, but I have not yet gotten the hang of it.  The second method is the tried and true press each button for each letter method.  My only problem with the phone is that the buttons are not the same shape and are spaced apart which makes text messaging a bit trickier at first.

A2AY4YUOX2N1BQ,B0001DVQNG,Ciaran,"[1, 2]","A few months ago, Sabrent sent me several samples of car inverters to try out, and I have been pleased with all of them so far. This review is my honest opinion.As I have mentioned in a previous review, these power inverters are not new and have been around for many years. Still, with mobile devices spreading like chicken-pox at a kindergarten, I have seen an upsurge in the amount of USB-charging inverters on the market. This particular charger offers dual USB charging (1A and 2.1A ports) as well as a standard power socket. Let's cut to the chase: this inverter functions excellently.Form is the only area I have to take issue, and it's not Sabrent's fault. My 2003 Subaru Outback has the AUX power (cigarette lighter) low down on the console, right behind the shifter, and with this inverter plugged in it's actually quite dangerous for me to have USB cables sticking out. If you're in the same boat as me, I highly suggest another inverter from Sabrent, also 150W:Half a star was taken off for the bulkiness of this product, another half star was taken off because I find the LED to be too bright and rather distracting during night-time driving.If you have the space, this is an excellent converter and a solid price.

A1E1LEVQ9VQNK,B0001DVQNG,J. Chambers,"[1, 1]","It's no problem charging mobile devices while you're driving, since these devices can be charged from a USB port, either built into the vehicle (newer models) or from USB chargers that fit in the vehicle's power port (aka cigarette lighter). But a lot of small electrical appliances are only made to work with AC power, and for those devices, a 12-volt in-vehicle power inverter is the answer. I have bought dedicated power adapters for laptop computers, but these are expensive and usually only work with a particular model laptop. I tried the Sabrent 75-watt inverter in my Subaru, and it worked fine for providing both AC and USB power. I used it with two of my AC-powered camera battery chargers and a AA battery charger:Canon G10 battery charger - 14 wattsNikon D3200 battery charger - 20 wattsMaha AA battery charger - 16 wattsI also used the inverter to charge my HP laptop while using the laptop. The laptop uses a maximum of 50 watts while running, which is well below the inverter's limits. While using the inverter for AC devices, I also recharged my Android smartphone with the 1A USB charging port.One caution: Every vehicle's electrical system has a maximum rated power that it can deliver through the vehicle's power port. For my Subaru Forester, the owner's manual says this is 120 watts. Trying to power a device or devices that exceed that limit will likely blow a fuse. I should also note that Subaru sells its own 100-watt power inverter for my vehicle, but it costs about $300, while the Sabrent inverter is a small fraction of that amount.For anyone who has a need for AC power in their vehicle, the Sabrent inverter is a good option to consider. The inverter is also available in 150 watts (Sabrent 150w Power Inverter with 2.1A-1A Dual USB Charger 12v DC to 120v AC (PW-C15U)) and 300 watts (Sabrent 300w Power Inverter with 2.1A-1A Dual USB Charger 12v DC to 120v AC (PW-C30U)).A product sample was provided by the manufacturer for review purposes.",5,Extraordinarily useful and much less expensive than auto manufacturers' inverters,1379376000,"09 17, 2013"

The ear plug stays in place, and I can still hear, but the boom swings downward from in front of my mouth (pulled by gravity) and then the person I'm talking with can't hear me so well.  The only thing that works for me in this regard is Plantronics, the one the hooks behind your ear lobe, but that one is not noise-canceling, so I can't hear as well when the wind noise gets high in the car.  The ones that hook over my ear hurt me, and the ones that just plug into my ear usually fall out.  This one is better in that it stays in my ear, but having the boom pivot away from my mouth is a real problem.  I tried bending it so it hangs down from my ear and then swings forward to my mouth, but the center of gravity still tries to swing to the lowest point, so I'd not a boom twice as long as this for that plan to really work.",3,Very good when it sits right,1268006400,"03 8, 2010"

It feels a little awkward to me, although if you're not moving it does stay in as long as you've ""pulled your ear back"" while inserting it, which creates a clamp effect between your ear canal and the rubber insert.  The earset itself is light enough to work this way.  The problem is the cable, which drags, gets bumped by clothing, etc, and jiggles things.  You have to clip the cable to your collar for sure, it's not optional like with over-the-ear headsets.  It comes with a little Y-shaped adapter which lets you use it with SKYPE or other PC-based systems.  Interestingly, while this works fine, the earset has a little whistle-y electronic noise with Etymotic that I don't hear (no matter how close I listen) with some other earsets I have.  It's not noticeable once a conversation starts. Overall, for most use, I don't find it's much better than a couple $7 dollar over-the-ear earsets Radio Shack used to stock (no longer do).  It may be, as someone reported, it's way better for wind noise, I haven't tried that.

I use it for 4-5 hrs per day on averagePros:Very high quality speaker. Like high quality headphones, if you phone has good signal it sounds great, but you'll hear lots of distortion with a poor signal. I use it with a blackberry 9650 and a femtocell - it is sounds as good as a high quality landline. It didn't sound as good with HTC and Samsung (CDMA) phones, but this is indicative of the quality of the phone's voice circuitry.Great noise cancelling microphone - with the windscreen on, you can use it outdoors even in strong wind (20 mph). Background noise is very muted and callers are usually amazed that I am on a cell.Works with glasses and hats - unit is held in place by friction. It's light enough so it works well. This makes it great for outdoor activities.Cord is perfect length and is designed to work with the phone on a belt clip or pants pocket. Form factor is great and it takes little space.Surprisingly, friction alone holds the unit in place. It is pretty durable too (sitting on it or dropping it)Cheap - for $35, it performs much better than the Jawbone/Plantronics bluetooth variety without the radiation risk and outperforms high end corded headsets too (call center sets, theBoom)Cons:2.5mm plug.

But just in the last 2 months the hub has been behaving completely opposite to expectations.  It goes totally dead with my hard drives, telling me that they're drawing too much power and therefore the hub is shutting them down until I remove them. But even when the hub is naked with the exception of a tiny flash drive, it remains dead, dark and non-communicative.  It comes back to life only when I disconnect the AC power and rely on nothing more than the power supplied by the USB ports.

Then I chanced upon this unlikely contender, looking more like a jukebox in Amazon's picture than a hub.  I was intrigued by the off-beat design and noticed that the price was competitive (though a couple of the others are presently offering rebates, a free flylight, and other sweeteners). Now that I'm looking at the CyberPower USB port ""in person,"" I can provide a few initial impressions:1.  It's a lot smaller than the picture might imply.  Compactness is nice, but you also want a hub that will stay put and that allows sufficient space between adjacent plugs.2.  Although the hub is designed for either vertical or horizontal use, the added and welcome weight of the detachable base makes vertical use the more sensible option.  Otherwise, you've got a lightweight (and fairly generic) loaded-up plug which could easily move around, dislodging the USB mini-plug (a necessary evil except for small cameras) at one end of every USB 2.0 cable.3.  It seems to handle my equipment off of the USB power supplied by the computer, but I still breathe easier using the included AC power adapter. (To the manufacturer's credit, it's one of the slimmer, lighter wall-warts that I've seen.)4.  The flash drive mount is practical (but not unique).  Now I can finally use that old Sandisk thumb drive that formerly was taking up the space of two USB ports.5.  The individual port lights are on all the time and, unlike most hubs, are not indicative of the presence or absence of a USB device.In conclusion, it's a reliable performer and a convenient as well as eye-catching device--providing you go for the vertical look.  If I were to suggest one design improvement, it would be to ""fatten up"" the tower so that it would be wide enough to permit horizontal insertion of USB devices with the hub in vertical position.  Doing so would assure unforced accommodation of all your USB plugs, even the most space-devouring ones.  Biggest ""gripe"": the vertical design is not real stable.  The hub is easily dislodged from the base and bounces around quite a bit.  If I had to do it over, I'd look at the heavy, dome-shaped Kensington.[Revaluation after almost 3 years: I tried the Kensington. It was no more stable but less reliable. So I returned to the CyberPower, but without the base or vertical position.  I velcroed its back side to the wooden surface behind my desktop machine, with printer and two 500GB storage drives inputted to the rear, one USB cable from the front side to the USB of my iMac, and a flash drive connected to the top side of the hub.  Absolutely no problems.  This item continues to rise in both popularity and price because it's so good.  Should it ever fail, I doubt there's any other hub available that could surpass it. Forget the ""cuteness"" factor; this thing is all business.][4 years later: This ""off brand"" hub continues to be an Amazon best-seller while hubs like the Kensington ""round mound"" have fallen off the map, so this one is a proven winner.  Only lately I've had some difficulty with getting it to recognize really large (1TB) hard drives. Before condemning the drive, I going to try some different cables and maybe a call to the manufacturer.  Otherwise, the next step up would be either a 3.0 USB hub or a hub with dedicated switches, permitting you to assign just the power-draining devices to the AC-powered inputs while allowing the other devices (iPods, mouse receivers, flash drives, printers, etc.) to run sheerly on USB power.]",5,4 years of flawless performance (I even bought another for my wife)--until now.,1200528000,"01 17, 2008"
A2HM2RMX1CBZGM,B000227PL8,"Taylor Marsh ""DESOLATER IV""","[0, 2]","For one, this product is built very cheap. This means that overtime some ports will simply stop working...why? I'm not really sure...perhaps cheap components, and slight bending?Secondly, it does not support charging, and yet it does at the same time. If you plug in say an apple device you'll get an error, but it will charge which again does not make sense.This is not a 3.0 USB hub, it's a 2.0. Many new devices will require you to have 3.0 now or in the near future. For instance, my new webcam hates being plugged into this hub as the performance greatly drops.Lastly: Mine is just about destroyed, because of a slight drink mishap. Nothing seems to be wrong with device other than...it stops working from time to time, and I sometimes have to clean the ports with a small amount of water to get it to work again..just very annoying.- Additional Notes: The Stand is horrible. It won't stay on, especially if you have multiple cords attached that pull in various directions like the power cable. (It falls out easily, it does not snap on, it's basically just a slightly heavy stand that it ""rests"" on top of. (Useless)- It glows neon Blue. Why? I'm not sure. I like it because it matches my setup, but it's very bright, and I'd rather the ""power"" be used towards the other devices.Finally: This device will likely not support 7 devices being plugged in at the same time....I would get 3-4 to work...maybe.... at any given point. Eventually the two bottom ports simply decided to ""not work"" entirely which is completely stupid because I rarely ever used those ports to begin with. This also made me think there was something wrong with my device, and wasted my time trouble shooting.

A14EF1PPKMSEPU,B00022NE6I,"E. Brown ""EB""","[12, 16]","OPERATION: It's like BMW's I-Drive - It does it's job, but has the most unintuitive, overly-layered interface. For example, the memory card is under the battery. The phone must be shut down & taken apart to change the memory card... and turning the phone back on takes a little while. This is representative of the entire phone operation. Not for the impatient.If you've never used an advanced mobile phone before, you might assume this is par for the course, but it simply isn't. Even the instruction booklet is out of order.APPLICATIONS: It has lots of applications and they work very well... when you eventually find where they are and they finally open. No matter how accustomed to the phone you become, too much time is required to get to, open and close applications. On the other hand, one may leave many applications open at once, hide them and return to them just where they left off - similar to a Mac. Me likes.The 6600 has more ameneties than most - World phone, Camera (VGA/zoom/night mode/timer), Video (w/ audio & zoom), Speaker (good sound), Bluetooth, infrared, Modem for computers, electronic wallet, Internet access, Calendar, calculator, converter and more.The phone does not have an Mp3-player, FM radio, 200k+ color screen, megapixel camera, quad band, PDA, photo editor. I'm not sure that a phone w/ these and all of the above features exists just yet. ...I'm not sure I'd want to spend THAT much time w/ a device, anyhow.DEPENDABILITY: I've seen no glitches. I've had no problems w/ this phone.STYLING/ERGONOMICS: The keys are small, which generally doesn't bother me if they are spaced because I can employ a little 'Braille,' but the keys run into each other, so careful attn. must be paid when dialing.As for appearance, well, that's subjective. Few will look at the phone and know it's 'all that'. It's not as stylized as a Sony or Samsung. Less Benz/obvious; more Audi/understated.Although it has chubby hips, the device isn't really so big. Solid, squeak-free, large screen.MEMORY/STORAGE - Seemingly boundless. First of all, the phone houses a great deal of memory for multiple videos, sound clips, photos, texts, etc. Secondly, all info can be sent to a computer and w/o the hassle of USB wires. Still not sure? If you max out the phone memory and have sent all you wish to a computer, there is a memory card w/a good deal of storage as well. This is no small deal. If you're still whining about storage, deleting some games will free-up still more memory.RECEPTION: This really depends on locale & carrier. The 6600 (T-Mobile) is the true 'world phone' in that it has the mhz to operate around the globe, including New Zealand and Australia (900) whereas the  6620 (available from Cingular) replaces it w/ 800mhz (some refer to as 850). The latter will provide better coverage in more remote areas of The States but still operates in many countries, excluding New Zealand and Australia. The 6600 will provide similar service in more developed areas of The States and not as well in more remote areas. As the 6600 uses 900mhz, it operates in more countries than the 6620.The battery life is less than stellar, but it charges w/ the quickness. Remember, this phone uses an operating system - Symbian... and it's feature-rich w/ 65k colors. It films 10 second video, for crying out loud. The battery life can't be very long; let's not be greedy.GAMES - Java. Don't use them, so I delete them for addtl space. In my humble opinion, games, along w/ 'flip phones' belong in the hands of teenagers.IMP: Two important pieces of advice - Visit Nokia's site. There are number of downloads needed/available for this phone & they will be texted to you at no cost. The downloads are for basic and advanced operations.The second piece of advice - Be prepared to spend a lot of time w/ this phone. If you expect to be able to pick things up when you're out and in a rush via common sense, many times you'll end up frustrated. A Sony Ericcson may be the phone for you... but good luck finding one w/ all the features & such a competitive price. Keep in mind that for nearly every screen, there are a number 'along side' and 'beneath' them... for every 'save,' there are choices of phone memory, memory card or sim card.Despite a critical start, this phone deserves four stars because it accomplishes what it sets out to do (which is pretty lofty)... does more than most... does it well... is dependable. It's a high-line Audi, on a Cadillac suspension, at a reasonable price.When you consider expandability (downloads via computer), the numerous features, two transmission programs and multiple storage devices, dependability - this is a phone that isn't easy to out-grow.I would suggest this phone for all but the simple-minded... or those who simply don't need so many features.",4,High technology and lots of it w/a sluggish operation system,1110326400,"03 9, 2005"

A18MBO1U4DPY20,B00022NE6I,Harkanwar Anand,"[14, 14]","Its been 11 months now that I've held on to my Nokia 6600 for. I purchased this phone knowing it was slightly old as compared to the newer models of Nokia phones available. I thought it was kind of steeply priced at that time. I must add to the dismay/delight of readers this phone is simply the most groundbreaking phone mankind has ever held. It has raised the bar owing to number of features it offers and the absolute ease of use delight.Now I'm a techy and like getting technical about things so I'd brief you in on the few features I liked about this phone-1.The Phone has the best keypad any Nokia phone has to offer. My dad has a Nokia 6670 before which he has a Nokia 7210 and before that he had a Nokia 6610. I think the keypad on your cell phone is the most important thing for me as Im constantly sending messages , calling people and fiddling around with my phone. Believe me when I say this I have used and fingered all Nokia phones and the 6600 has the best keypad2. The looks are absolutely no nonsensical. Some complain it being a tad too bulky looking. I must admit its not the best looking phone ever but then it has this look of static and absolute conviction that looks like everything a phone should be3. The Nokia 6600 has a brilliant Java interface. There's a whole lot of things you can do with this phone besides reading a book , playing various Java games , having a variety of software installed. The Phone offers a 32 Mb MMC card and I think that is certainly the most exciting feature. I upgraded mine to a 128 MB MMC Card via which I can store unlimited number of messages, take a thousand pictures and videos. Capacity is not a problem here.4. The Build is just right. The phone is sturdy. I've dropped it atleast a dozen times to my recolletion and it still works as good as ever. Its a tough one this unless you wanna drive your car over it. This isn't the most rugged phone ever but then your not gonna play aeroplane with this,are you.5.The Camera installed on this phone is awesome. I click pictures in JPG format and because the phone has a bluetooth device I find it extremely easy to transfer pics to my pc and forth. The display and brightness on this phone is quite extraordinary. The use of 65536 (16bit) colors ensures you get your share of animations and icons on your phoneBesides the above mentioned Merits , the phone has decent ear volume and loudspeaker functionality. It has great upgradibility. I can play MP3 files on my phone by simply downloading softwares freely available on the net. Now that is neat. The log functions helps you track down the incoming , outgoing calls in the most easy of ways.The handsfree provided by the phone is useful for those who talk on the phone while driving. I wouldn't do that because it's not worth my life.Anyhow some demerits of this phone,The phone has a slow processor and the ear volume is lower than 6610 but then the 6610 has the best ear volume among most Nokia variants.The battery life of this phone is at most 2 days and at least one day at excessive use. Video recording is limited at just 9 seconds. You can upgrade but then there's a certain level of trouble involved.Overall I dont think I will ever upgrade from this phone. When I purchased this phone , I thought to myself that I had purchased the most popular phone around and the thought didn't please me. In any case , putting aside how common it is in my city , I dont think I can be anymore satisfied.

The EarWave Boom is a good model that will satisfy 90% of people who need hands-free functionality for their cell phones.Jabra has gotten away from the full molded ear gels for this model.  I personally prefer them to the mini ear gels, but this unit fits fine in your ear with the ear wrap-around.  It's comfortable and works fine.As for the hands-free jack on your phone, you have to make sure you have a 2.5 millimeter jack. That is the one with 2 stripes on the plug. Calling this ""Universal"" is a little bit of an overstatement, but with a little research you can verify which model fits your phone.  Unfortunately, a specific compatibility list is hard to come by. Look at the specs for your phone and give it a try.The microphone will capture sound just fine.  For those who experience a lot of interference or muffling, I recommend you try the version with ""Noise Cancelling.""  It's about $7 more but for certain models of phone the difference can be worth it.The Jabra EarWrap has a slightly better wraparound attachment and a slightly longer arm. For those who don't like the microphone arm, the Jabra EarWave Bud doesn't have a microphone arm, but instead has the small mic on the cable with a clip to attach it to your tie or shirt. Personally I don't like those models.I have not found much difference in sound quality between the different Jabra models.  The differences are mainly in comfort, style, and ease of use.

Right out of the box it was easy to pair with my Motorola v505 phone.It is small and unobtrusiveThe battery life is really good in standby mode, and lasts several hours of talking. (and it does issue warning tones when the battery runs low, plus the phone issues a message saying ""headset signal weak - switch to handset?""The combo belt clip/charger is a really cool idea.  It would have been EVEN COOLER if Jabra had made it compatible with nokia, Moto, and Ericsson phone chargers.  Now I have yet ANOTHER power supply to drag with me on trips....Reception is very good as long as line of sight is unobstructed by anything full of water.  I can pump gas in my car with the phone on the passenger seat or wander all over my hotel suite waving my arms wildly while the phone sits in its charging stand on the desk.  If there is a body in the way (or an aquarium, etc) then the signal drops off (attenuates) dramatically.  In fact, there is a marked difference between putting the phone on the opposite side of your body from the earpiece when carrying your phone in your pocket.  If on the opposite side, the signal degrades noticeably.The Cons:I have been unsuccessful getting it to pair with either my laptop or my PDA however (an HP iPaq 4155).If you have a bluetooth PDA and use BT to Activesync with your PC, it will interfere with this headset while it is ""connected"" (from Activesync's perspective).  You will hear a constant ""crackling"" noise that sounds like the other person is popping popcorn.  It took me a while to figure out.  You don't have to turn off the BT radio on the laptop or PDA, just ""disconnect"" the BT session temporarily while talking.  This is a hassle, but not a killer (one of the reasons for 4 instead of 5 stars)My biggest problem with the unit is that it does not fit my ears without feeling very insecure.  The ""hanging"" design always feels like it is flopping around for me, and if I lean too far to that side, the unit will actually fall off my ear.  There is no way to tighten the fit of the unit; I have already tried different earpieces and positions of the earpieces, but this doesn't help.  This is the reason why I will probably replace this unit with another.

The jabra design provides a much better and more comfortable fit even with glasses on. the other two has flimsy over the ear plastic pieces that feel very out of place.I felt this unit to be relatively easier to use as compared to the other two. I had NO problems teaming either of the units with the 3650. I did have to jump through a few hoops to team with the V600.THE most important reason I wanted a BT adapter in the first place was to due to the fact that i get a phone signal in my liviing room and there is no signal at my desk in the basement which is directly under the living room. The reception was about the same for both (not use-able). I also noticed that when I went around the corner, I would lose the signal. true for all units.All in all, I would rate each one as follows on a scale from 1 to 5:Quality : jabra-4, Nokia-3, Motorola-2.5Design: Jabra-5, Nokia-1, Motorola-1usabaility (range): Jabra-3, Nokia-3, Motorola-3usability (ease of use): Jabra-4, Nokia-3, Motorola-3Overall: Jabra-4, Nokia-2, Motorola-2One thing i did not get to test was the battery life.

While it is SUPPOSED to work in a range of 33 feet, I found that if I merely put the phone on the opposite side of my body, the connection gets fickle.  You get lots of staticy noise if the phone is more than 2 feet from the earpiece and in a direct line of sight.  Sort of defeats the purpose of the bluetooth technology, doesn't it?

I like the shape, it's comfortable enough to wear all day (and I wear it from 7:30 a.m. to about 9:00 p.m.), and the battery lasts almost forever. The headset loads into the charger like a knife into its sheath. The charger even has an accessory belt clip so you can carry it with you as a holster for the headset. The sound is loud and clear unless you drive with your windows down, and the ear gel can be adjusted to put the sound right where you want it. So why 4 stars?My only complaint is that aside from being wearable on either ear, this headset is totally NOT adjustable. Perhaps the shape of my face and/or ear is unusual, but the earpiece keeps pulling away from my ear. Add to that the fact that the headset wants to work itself off my ear entirely, and the lack of adjustability is a problem for me. Lest anyone wonder, I'm not a small person and my ears sit stylishly flat against my head.I solved the foregoing problems by cutting a heavy duty paperclip to length, bending it into the appropriate shape, and taping it to the headset with electrician's tape. Then I bent the wire so that the earpiece fits snugly into my ear. As a bonus, the tape adds a little extra bulk around the upper loop of the headset, which helps hold everything in place. Problem solved, but why not engineer some adjustibility in during design?I'd still buy it, no problem there, but I can't give it five stars because the lack of built-in adjustibility is, to me, a definite oversight.",4,Almost Excellent,1143849600,"04 1, 2006"

Despite a few bad reviews, the sound quality is acceptable for making telephone calls and dicatation, though the sampling rate is obviously too low to listen to music with it. I easily paired it with a Sony-Ericsson t68i and my 15"" Powerbook running Mac OS X 10.3.8.My quick testing with iChat AV was positive and it seems quite usable for use with an iSight for the voice portion of a call. I also was able to set the sound output to the headset and am currently listening to some music with it, but the low sample rate and the fact that it isn't in stereo makes this only a novelty. Nevertheless, it is still useful when a real pair of headphones are not available.The range, as mentioned in other reviews, isn't amazing, but was sufficient to move about an average-sized room and worked intermittently through a cinder block wall.It fit fairly comfortably on my ear and seems to easily hide, though is a bit cumbersome to put on at first. The multiple earpieces are also a plus. The dual charger/belt clip is an interesting idea, but seems to be poorly executed. It seems somewhat unstable, so I'm not sure I'd actually keep it on my belt. However, it might not be bad for riding around clipped to something inside of my backpack.All in all, it's not a bad device, though there is certainly some room for improvement.

There aren't many ear mounted devices that I can get on with at all, so if you have big ears this may be for you.Sound: Received sound is weak at best, if you don't have good hearing this isn't going to work for you. Transmitted sound is also weak, apparently, I have to accept what others tell me. If I want to talk quietly I have to use the phone, the headset forces me to talk loudly so that I can be heard. Noise cancelling is non-existant, if it was supposed to have any. The draught from the AC vents on the car is enough to cause callers to complain.RF: With the v505 it takes an unreasonable amount of time for the headset and the phone to get it together. You can't answer the phone by switching the headset on when you hear it ringing, by the time it's connected to the phone the call is in voicemail. Received audio is OK, but whenever I used the headset I am told that I sound very digitized. As a communications engineer I believe that some people need a serious talking to over the bluetooth performance.All in all I'd keep looking, which is why I'm browsing headsets now.In ten years I really haven't yet found a ""good"" headset, nothing approaching the standard of the military and aviation headsets I used to use, like comparing a ZX80 to a 3GHz Dell Pentium 4. Perhaps I just have unreasonable expectations, but if I could actually get a headset with good audio and good noise cancelling I'd pay a couple of hundred bucks.

I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because of two annoyances:1. The numbers are accessible only through function keys - a bit of a pain. I would have preferred another row of keys. It wouldn't have added that much size or weight.2. When the keyboard is open, it's supported in the middle by what becomes the case and the ends extend on either side like wings.

It's great for writing a longer e-mail, inputting contacts, or writing a letter in word, when you don't want to peck at the screen with your stylus endlessly.  The construction feels solid and opening and closing is a snap.  Pun intended. The only major flaw is with the cradle that holds your PDA.  It is removable which is the desired use to space the PDA a little further away from you.  But the feet that clip it to the keyboard just don't want to let go.  The plastic it's made out of doesn't seem especially robust and I feel certain it will snap off eventually.  Also the curved lower part of the cradle that holds your Axim, et al, is a little under developed and if bumped will readily jettison what it's holding.

I had major problems with lag: characters I typed simply didn't make it to the screen.Taking a chance, I bought the Stowaway Bluetooth keyboard . . . and I am very, very impressed.Set-up is very quick and Stowaway's set-up software is simple to use. Reading the short user's manual (not the brief Quick Start) is a must. The learning curve isn't steep, but because the keyboard is intended as a ""universal"" device, tweaks have to be made for using it with Palm or Pocket PC devices.Once set up, the keyboard performs superbly well. Every key I struck showed up immediately onscreen. I have large hands and I was concerned that I would encounter many typos because of my large fingers. I needn't have worried. The keys have a firm touch and the spacing is wide enough to keep typos to a miniumum. Because of the immediate feedback provided by Bluetooth, I felt no tendency to go back and retype because the character didn't show up. I had no idea that the IR keyboard with its lag was causing me to do that so much.Others have commented about instability because the ends of the keyboard are essentially unsupported. At first this struck me as a design flaw, but within a few minutes this is easily compensated for. I had little difficulty with my keystrokes causing the keyboard to rock.Some have also complained about devices slipping off the minimal stand provided. I had no problems with the Treo 650 or Palm TX.Finally a number of people have complained that there is no fifth row for entry of numbers. You have to use a function key + number combination or you can set the keyboard to number lock. If you have to enter a lot of numeric data, the complaints are justified. On the other hand, for people like me who have limited need for numeric entry, it is an inconvenience, but not a major one. I'm happy to trade a fifth row for numerics for the small size of the unit.Construction of the unit is typical for many of today's products. It's plastic with some metal, but overall it does not feel like it is built like a tank. On the other hand, it doesn't feel overy flimsy either. Time and use will tell how well the unit stands up.Overall, this unit makes it eminently possible to use handheld devices like the Treo 650 and Palm TX for serious typing. I was surprised to find that I could type almost as rapidly on this keyboard as I can on a full-sized unit.

Its metal case and relatively simple folding mechanism result in a durable product that has given me years of reliable service. The keyboard feels great; the throw of the keys is nice and tactile feedback is on a par with many laptop keyboards. My fingers are none too slim and they easily fit on to this keyboard. Like many of us, these days, I'm a touch typist and I find using this keyboard as comfortable as any I might find, particularly on most laptop computers. I've owned a couple of these - not because they wear out (I still own and use the first one I purchased, nearly a decade ago) - but because I find it's useful to have one at my bedside and another in my gear bag.Powered by AAA batteries makes it easy to operate. There's no proprietary power source or charging system required. It sips power, too; I find it lasts and lasts on a pair of NiMH rechargeable batteries.Pairing with a phone or other device is very simple. However, my Symbian phones do not handle this as they should any authorized peripheral. I have to manually connect; I cannot just turn the keyboard on and start to type, in order to get the keyboard and phone to connect. I suspect this a deficiency with the Symbian OS and not with the keyboard.The folding stand is very useful and fits a variety of devices of roughly phone-size, in either a portrait or landscape configuration.Even without its zippered case, this keyboard travels very nicely and has a durable aluminum shell.Why didn't I give this a perfect 5-star rating? The keypad is available, I think, only with the functions of the old Palm OS mapped on to the keys. It doesn't undermine the use of the keyboard with other operating systems, but can sometimes be distracting that the keys are printed with functions either not available on your phone's operating system or the keys cannot actually perform that function.I find it very unfortunate that most so-called ""smart phones"" do not support mapping special functions on to Bluetooth keyboards. Admittedly, this is not a shortcoming of the keyboard itself. Phone manufacturers are simply more interested in equipping their systems with eye-candy and games, rather than the kinds of productivity enhancements which might make their devices more useful to those of us who try to rely upon them to aid is in our work and home lives.It is astonishing to me that this keyboard isn't more popular and being emulated by other manufacturers. It would be terrific if it were to ship with software that could enable iOS, Android, and Symbian devices to map functions to its keys.I highly recommend this keyboard, if you are looking for a durable, reliable, and comfortable folding Bluetooth keyboard for your handheld device.",4,Still among the top folding Bluetooth keyboards available,1302480000,"04 11, 2011"

A1N03V52IRZ5PR,B0002OKCXE,"N. J. Simicich ""Gadget Geek""","[2, 2]","It always worries me when devices like this are still being sold at retail, while third party sellers are able to sell them for under what wholesale would seem to be for the stated retail price. Usually this reflects a liquidation by the manufacturer. But sometimes that allows you to try a gadget that you otherwise might not be able to afford. And if you need the gadget for its originally designed purpose, it may well be just what you want, despite being obsolescent. It is pure speculation on my part, but I believe that the market need now requires F1-F12 keys and this device does not have them.I've considered PDA keyboards before but they always impressed me as flimsy junk, not possibly able to stand up to the rigors of travel or even more than occasional use. This one is different - I believe that if I put it in its little paddded bag it could go into my black bag and come out after 6 trips, two weeka later, in the same shape, ready to go when I needed it.  The aluminum construction seems as solid as it poaaibly can for a folding device.When I look at the support forums for the device on the manufacturer's web site, I see that people are asking about support for portable windows devices.  This keyboard has no traditional windows function keys (originally F1-F10, now (and for many years) F1-F12) [Sidebar: Why 12?  Because that is how many the IBM 3270, a special purpose mainframe terminal used by the designers had] and without those you probably can't use it effectively with windows. I paired it with my laptop, and I was able to use it as a keyboard, without special drivers.  Probably, with a great free program called anyhotkey I could get it to simulate the sending of pfks using extra non-momentary shifts, but why?  A wireless or wired full sized keyboard is what you need on a system like this.I had no trouble getting used to left (blue) function shifting for numbers and right (green) function shifting for top line punctuation, although I wish the silk screening had been against an ivory background and not the gunmetal grey one.  While it might be possible for a driver to use multiple shifts to simulate F1-F12, what then about shifted keys? If the shift to get F4 includes a chord with the alt key, how would you then type alt-F4? The only possible way I could see was if this was something that you got by pushing both blue and green shifts and the top line, but if you then accidentally hit cntl, you'd put the keyboard into pairing mode.So I believe that they are, as I write this, available at a great price for their intended market - Palm PDAs, Some Smartphones, and such. But not having function keys limits this keyboard's future, specifically Windows Mobile devices that can be used with a full Bluetooth keyboard won't be fully functional when you use this device as a keyboard.One other thing that I did was to try it with my PS3.  Works great, and the PS3 does not use F1-F12, so this is probably the perfect occasional use keyboard for the PS3 - you can text with it, or type addresses if you are surfing, or use it for naming things without having to have a full sized keyboard wired to the PS3 (or a full sized bluetooth keyboard taking up space). Nothing special, I just paired it and then typed the number the PS3 gave me on its screen.My main use for this is as a keyboard formy Palm T|X. I downloaded the drivers and synced the T|X.  I then went through setting up a secure connection. The only thing that I do not like (and I am not sure what to do about it) is that whenever I want to use the keyboard, I can't just open it up and start using it. I have to open it, go to applications, start the keyboard application, go into bluetooth configuration, tell it to connect, dismiss the warning that the keyboard has to be paired in the device list, and then do the cntl-greenFN-blueFN chord to make the keyboard discoverable. Then it connects and the keyboard works, and I can change to another application and the keyboard still works.This needs to be done often enough that I made an input area icon (the touchscreen areas that allow you to immediately bring up an application) start the keyboard app.I believe that this is an issue with the way the Palm OS works. Other systems don't seem to need this manual restart of the drivers.Once that is done, so long as the palm does not need to be reset, the keyboard will work as soon as it comes on - so long as you do not use another bluetooth device. According to the release notes, the Palm Bluetooth support can only talk to one device at a time. If the keyboard is unused, it will power down after a couple minutes. But when you touch a key, it will resume communications immediately, without going through the menu. No, it is not a full sized keyboard, and there are some compromises, but it has a really good feel, even compared to many full sized keyboards I own.When one opens the keyboard, the first thing to do is to extend the palmtop support. The little arm that the palmtop rests on is spring loaded, and pops past a stop - if you like it at that first stop, be careful to block the rest with your thumb. There is a release on one side to open the keyboard, a release on the top that holds the keyboard open and which needs to be released when you want to close it. Just go slow.There is a single feedback light.  Off? Keyboard is not connected. Fast blink? Keyboard is ready to connect. Slow blink? Keyboard is connected. Red? Low battery.Simple, easy to use, and works well. This is not a PC keyboard, and it is not a heavy stationary keyboard.

It is the same as this product but the keys are black.  The keyboard works great.  The keyboard folds up flat and is about 4""x6"" and it is thin.  It folds out to a full size keyboard, when opened the keyboard latches so it won't fold up when you are typing and the keys have a great feel.  Loading the software to my Axim x30 and configuring the keyboard went smoothly and although I am somewhat comfortable with technology  I am not a ""techie"" by any measure.  The bluetooth is great and there is no need to carry cables and wires and this option has worked well for me for the past two years.The only problem I have is with the stand.  The stand is made with very flimsy plastic; although the manual says that it is detachable I would recommend extreme caution. After two years of extremely careful treatment my stand broke.I don't know if Think Outside, Inc. will sell me this plastic part (I plan to contact them) but Dell does not stock or sell this part even though it is detachable; it does not take a genius to see that this part will not wear well.  After being transferred to four departments and then told to call their parts store the fifth Dell customer service representative told me to either purchase a new keyboard for $99.00 or carry my cradle around.  This seems silly and wasteful.If you work from one location and can use your cradle to hold your Pocket PC this is not an issue.  But if like me you purchased this for travel and portability and do not take your cradle with you this is a problem.So this is a great product with the above exception.

Here's how I find these two compare:- Battery life: Moto wins. This thing keeps on going, and lasts even longer than the already amazing HBS-730. Too bad the remaining battery life estimator is so inaccurate (it reports 4 hours remaining on a full charge, when it's much closer to 10)- Convenience and durability: Moto wins again. The Buds sit tight around your neck and don't bounce. The cords are not as fragile on the LGs, and the magnets holding the earbuds are much stronger on the Moto Buds. Unlike the HBS-730 and 800, the Buds do not report their power level to the Bluetooth host (the iPhone shows a little bar next to the bluetooth icon indicating the battery status when you use the LG headphones). That's funny since the older SF600 have the feature.- Ergonomy: LG wins big time. The button layout and functionality are intuitive and logical on the LG, and completely convoluted and inconvenient on the Buds; on the Buds, the same button is used for FF (one press) or REW (two presses); also, the power button on the LG is a sliding switch, whereas the Buds use an electronic switch which makes it much more difficult to find out if your headset is on or off.- Sound quality: I would rate the Buds somewhere between the 700 and the 730; mostly, they lack bass and presence.- Range: excellent, but the outlandish 150ft range advertised is only available when connected to a Bluetooth Class 1 device, and these are rare -- only featured on a few Motorola phones as far as I could tell. When connected to a Class 2 device (which most devices are) the range is 33ft like all other devices; I think Motorola is a little disingenuous when advertising this extended range.In conclusion... They're not bad, and if the LG series didn't exist they would deserve 5 stars. However, considering they're a blatant rip-off of a successful concept, it's disappointing that Motorola improved on some of the flaws of the HBS series (mostly the cord durability and the magnet strength) but failed to pick up on the ergonomy (button layout, power switch).Which one should you pick? in my opinion, the cheapest one you can find, unless you need to connect to two devices, in which case the Moto Buds or the HBS-800 are a must; and if you easily get irritated and confused by complicated controls, stay away from the Buds.Recommended, but they're not the LG HBS-series killer that Motorola probably designed them to be.",4,"Not bad, but stick to the original",1397779200,"04 18, 2014"

No problem working up a sweat on the treadmill, but I must stress that I've not put in a summer run. I also must say that I do not expect longevity from a non-sweatoroof product, and that the s11 headphones are designed with a sweatproof nano coating. HOWEVER, since you asked, they still sound and work excellent. They bounce around running, but it's not intolerable... Just not ideal.  BATTERY: I've used them every day since I got them, and often times days at the house studying all day and going to the gym.  They last from morning to night constantly connected.  I often forget I'm wearing them when I turn on my music and don't hear any sound from my phone/tablet.Edit: just for the record, the Motorola site says these are NOT for working out (under questions about product, it says not sweatproof and should be kept away from moisture). I'm going to work out in them anyway and I'll report back when they fail.=============================================================I bought the jaybird bluebuds x for my girlfriend, and I've used them several times, so that is my comparison point.These headphones have a very utilitarian, price conscious design. They don't sound as awesome as the $180 bluebuds, and they aren't as sleek as them (bluebuds are just a cord with tiny ear pieces). BUT, they are very easy to control, very light, and sound very good. I'm not taking away anything by saying they don't sound as good as the bluebuds... The bluebuds sound as good as Bose or klipsch wired models of similar cost (even MKBHD says they are amazing). The Motorola buds really sound great. I'd choose them based on sound over any of the cheaper wired sets I have (skull candy, JVC, etc.)The ear pieces, at first, I was worried about them. They didn't look like they would be very secure, but I was wrong. You can easily work out with them and they will stay in. And they swivel a bit at the ear pieces, so every time you move, you don't hear a bunch of thumping like many in-ear wired sets.And taking them out to hear the world around you is nice, because of the magnets. No flopping around.The built-in equalizer settings are nice, the controls are easy, and they stay around your neck when laying on your back.So you sacrifice some portability over the bluebuds, but you get a great ease of use, very good sound, and less than half the price.And truthfully, while they aren't super stylish...

A360VP3RBMJFDL,B0002SYC5O,Voyn238,"[41, 41]","SPOILER ALERT: this is a stupidly long review. I like to provide as much detail as possible when I write a review, because that&#8217;s the sort of thing I look for in other reviews. Buying things from online retailers is great and all, but it prevents us from getting any hands-on information until we&#8217;ve already shelled out our money. Detailed reviews are the best way to combat disappointment and buyers&#8217; remorse. So either get some popcorn and/or a coffee, or skip to the end, or skip this review entirely &#61514;  Seriously though, it&#8217;s a long review. Prepare yourself.This headset is about as close to ideal as I'm probably ever going to get, at least until headsets are implanted subdermally behind the ear, or when music and communications are beamed directly into the brain or something. It has great sound, features, fit, and looks. There are a few downsides which I'll get out of the way first, and then I can get back to gushing about this thing. First, I feel that the earbud cords are maybe .5 to .75 inches too short. I wear this mainly when I&#8217;m at work, underneath the collar of my polo shirt. The cords therefor have to dip down under the edge of the collar, and then make the trip back up to my ears. It's fine if I'm looking straight ahead, but if I turn my head too much it will tug on the 'outside' ear (if I look left, it tugs on my right ear and vice versa). I've gotten around this somewhat by removing the little silicone o-rings that are intended to manage the earbud cords. It releases a little more cord length so the tugging is less noticeable, but it is still there. The cords are a bit short for my taste even when wearing a t-shirt, but aren&#8217;t too bad. The next downside is that the headset does not support connection to two devices at once. I get that this &#8220;one device at a time&#8221; thing improves the handoff between music and calls, since this is easier when both services are provided by one phone/device, but I still wish I could listen to my personal phone's music collection while being able to take calls from my work phone. Other headsets like the Sony MW600 handle this with ease. I should clarify that the Buds can be PAIRED with multiple devices, but can only be connected to one device at a time. Currently, I&#8217;ve got them paired with my Android tablet and phone, my iPod, and my work iPhone. I can switch from one to another by manually disconnecting from one and connecting to another (via each device&#8217;s settings), so I don&#8217;t have to go through the pairing process every time I want to switch &#8211; pairing the Buds is not difficult at all, but that would get annoying real quick.Now that I've got that out of the way, I can talk about the stuff I like about the Buds, which is pretty much everything. First off, let me assure you that this headset DOES support Apt-X Bluetooth connections where available. Apt-X is a Bluetooth audio codec that is designed to provide sound quality equal to a wired headset. Other Bluetooth audio connections have to compress the audio, making it sound somewhat muddled and, well, bad. This happens regardless of the quality of your source audio file. Apt-X support is most commonly available in recent Samsung (including the Galaxy S3, S4, and S5) and HTC phones (including the One and M8), but there are others out there as well. If you&#8217;re interested, there is a ridiculously complete .xlsx spreadsheet available from jessebandersen dot com, but a simple Google search will also yield results. I found Jesse&#8217;s page by searching for &#8220;aptx enabled devices&#8221; &#8211; it was the first result in the list. Sadly Apt-X is not supported by Apple yet, and knowing them they'll come out with some proprietary alternative to it that only works with their own headsets (they bought Beats by Dre in the last week or so, so get ready). I almost passed on the Buds because Apt-X isn't listed anywhere in the specs or reviews that I saw here on Amazon. I had to go to Motorola's site and look up the user manual to find it. I was originally going to go with the LG Tone headset line (which also supports Apt-X), but didn't like the &#34;flat loop&#34; design that most of them have &#8211; it looks like a great fit&#8230; for a robot. In my opinion the Buds are designed for a better fit on an actual human: the front of the control stalks bend gently down, following the curve of the neck/shoulders/collarbones. The majority of the headset (including the very small weight of the battery pack) rests on the base of your neck, and the control stalks rest comfortably near the collarbones. The LG Tone can't do both at the same time since it is formed in a flat circle: the stalks aren&#8217;t angled relative to the neck band, and they carry all the weight of the battery so they&#8217;ll fall to your collarbones while the center section will be halfway up the back of your neck (the newer ones are curved like the Buds, but are $70 more expensive). I&#8217;m wearing the Buds headset right now, and can hardly feel it &#8211; a great improvement over traditional &#8220;earhugger&#8221; Bluetooth headsets. While I&#8217;m talking about fit, I should probably mention that I wear a 17.5&#8221; collar, and can&#8217;t stand having things touching my neck or throat. The Buds fit quite comfortably, and provide just the slightest reassuring touch on the front sides of my neck. They widest gap between the left and right control stalks measures just a hair under 5 inches.The Buds have a tidy control arrangement and are easy to navigate. Play/pause/answer/end/track-skip commands (as well as EQ settings and voice dial activation) are handled by a rocker switch on the left, and volume adjustments are handled by a rocker switch on the right. The microphone is underneath the rocker switch on the left, and the power switch is underneath the body (center section) of the headset, next to the charging port. Play/pause/answer/end is done by a single press of the forward half of the left rocker switch, which has a little bit of texture to it for identification/grip purposes. You can activate voice dialing (like Siri or Samsung&#8217;s S-Voice or Google voice search) by long-pressing this same button while no music is playing. Track-skip forward is done by a single press of the back half of the same switch, and track-skip back is done by a double press. I kind of wish skip forward/back were handled by separate buttons, but it&#8217;s easy enough to get used to. One thing to note about the mic being on the same stalk as the answer/end button: if you have to feel around for the end call button, the person on the other end is going to hear ALL OF IT since the microphone is right beneath it. Lots of loud rustling noises. Oops. Not enough for me to list as a full-on downside, but still... kind of annoying. They could have placed the mic on the right, which come to think of it is a whole lot less &#8220;busy&#8221; since it mostly only has volume control functions. Volume down is achieved by pressing the forward half of the right rocker switch, and volume up by pressing the back half. You can mute an active phonecall by pressing both portions of the volume rocker, and reject an incoming call by long-pressing either one of the volume buttons. EQ modes can be changed by a long-press of the &#8220;Play/Pause&#8221; switch on the left. There are 3 EQ modes, but there is no indication of which one you are in, or documentation of what the effects are supposed to be. There is a voice notification of &#8220;EQ mode changed!&#8221; but that&#8217;s it. You&#8217;re on your own to figure out exactly what that means. My best guess is that the modes are flat, treble boost, and bass boost. As a general &#8220;audiophile&#8221; rule, flat EQ response is best since it doesn&#8217;t meddle with the sound balance and you hear it as the artist intended. I can barely tell which EQ mode is bass boost, but can&#8217;t tell the difference between the other two. And if I can&#8217;t tell the difference, then I guess it doesn&#8217;t really matter. I&#8217;d recommend switching modes while listening to your general type of music, getting to an EQ setting you like, and then never changing it again. As is obvious from the pictures and literature, the earbuds are held magnetically to the ends of the control stalks when not in use. The magnets are pretty strong, and the earbuds have yet to bounce themselves loose. In fact, they are so strong that if I remove an earbud from my ear but don&#8217;t attach it to the end of the stalk, I&#8217;ll eventually find that it has connected itself at some point as I&#8217;ve been moving around. Needless to say, don&#8217;t get any of these parts too close to any of your credit cards.As far as sound quality goes, I&#8217;m really impressed. The earbuds are said to have &#8220;Premium HD speakers&#8221;, and whatever that truly means, they sound great and the Apt-X support really helps them shine. I should point out that the Buds will still sound great with non-Apt-X devices like Apple gadgets, and will certainly sound as good as all other Bluetooth headsets that don&#8217;t support it. As long as the earbuds are seated properly (which is critical with any in-ear earbuds) bass response is nice and solid, and everything just sort of sparkles. Not saying that &#8220;sparkle&#8221; is added in any way, but if the music has fine detail in it then you&#8217;ll hear a lot more of it. Speaking of having the earbuds seated properly, the documentation talks a bit about about &#8220;micro-adjustability&#8221;, and what this translates into is that the stem of each earbud can pivot a certain amount around a central axis in a sort of narrow cone shape, so the angle of the stem relative to the earbud&#8217;s body can change a bit to fit different peoples&#8217; ear structures. The earbuds seem to stay fairly well seated unless I get really sweaty. Speaking of sweat, I will also note that the Buds are not labelled as &#8220;sweat proof&#8221;, which does make me worry a little bit. I sweat easily, and do a lot of biking and walking, and my work is somewhat physical too. Hopefully this does not become an issue. There is a little rubber plug you have to partially remove to access the charging port, so make sure you place it back securely before getting sweaty. Anyways, back to audio quality: One important thing to note, which is true of all high quality sound delivery devices, is that the final output depends highly on good source material. You should know by now that low quality sources like 128Kbps .mp3 files or even some tracks on Pandora and other streaming services aren&#8217;t the best, and with these you will hear every little bit of their badness. Other headsets may mask this but they&#8217;re also masking the fine detail of better quality files, so in a way it&#8217;s actually a good thing. Call quality on both ends of the line is really good as well, and I&#8217;ve never had anyone ask &#8220;Are you using Bluetooth?&#8221; which I usually get when I use other headsets. In fact, I had one person stop me in mid-conversation and ask &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you say you were going to put on your bluetooth headset?&#8221;, and almost didn&#8217;t believe me when I said I already had. One last thing about audio quality &#8211; if you listen to music via any app with preamp gain, you may want to be reduce that gain level to zero. I use PowerAmp on my Galaxy S4 and was dismayed at first to hear a ton of distortion, especially in the low end. I almost returned the headset because I could not get rid of it. I eventually found that the preamp gain (on PowerAmp&#8217;s EQ settings page) was set to about 75% of its capacity, and turning it down eliminated the distortion completely. You can get rid of the distortion at 25%, but why risk it? I keep it at zero now just to be sure. Doing so also reduced the overall volume, but since these things get plenty loud on their own, I don&#8217;t mind at all.Usually I hate the looks of most Bluetooth headsets: the obnoxious blinking blue lights and the giant blobs of techno-crud clamped to peoples&#8217; ears make them look like extras from bad 80&#8217;s sci-fi movies. I have to say that the Motorola Buds practically disappear, especially while wearing them under the collar of a polo shirt. They do have an indicator light, but it is nestled in between the power switch and charging port, so it&#8217;s not visible at all while they&#8217;re being worn. I have to say, at first I wasn&#8217;t too pleased with the fact that even the black headset has white bits on it (the undersides of the flat cords, the silicone ear pieces, and the forward/inside halves of the earbud shells). I have changed my mind and have very much come to enjoy the subtle high-contrast design. It looks nice and modern without looking like it&#8217;s trying too hard. As I said, it practically disappears under a polo collar &#8211; all you can see is the white silicone ear pieces and a touch of the white from the cord. When you&#8217;ve got an earbud inserted, the white flash from the undersides of the cords help make it a little more obvious to others that you&#8217;re either listening to music or talking on the phone. I say &#8220;a little&#8221; because people still give me weird looks when they walk into a room while I&#8217;m in mid conversation. I have to make the universal &#8220;I&#8217;m not a lunatic, I&#8217;m just on the phone&#8221; gesture to most folks, but the observant ones can figure it out for themselves more easily. I see these now come in blue, which makes me even more sad that they don&#8217;t come in red. You see, I have a sickness. A sickness which has yet to be defined (or even acknowledged) by Science, in which I have an overwhelming love (some, like my wife, would say &#8220;unhealthy obsession&#8221;) for black things with red trim, or red things with black trim, or&#8230;  well, you get the idea. If these came in red, I&#8217;d sell 4 of my 5 pints of blood (or at least my black/white Buds) to get a set. Maybe one day.Those are the main points I wanted to talk about. There are a few more things that don&#8217;t really fit in the review elsewhere, so I&#8217;ll stick them here. The specs say that the wireless range is up to 150 feet, but that is with a &#8220;Class 1 Bluetooth device&#8221;, which your phone probably isn&#8217;t. Realistic use is still around 30 to 40 feet, with minor barriers like walls and doors. I don&#8217;t even know where to find a true Class 1 Bluetooth device, so get that 150ft range spec out of your head. Battery life seems to be pretty good, and although I try to charge the headset every night, I&#8217;ve gone as far as 2 full workdays of mixed usage without running out of battery. They&#8217;re rated at &#8220;up to 12 hours&#8221; of playback, but it&#8217;s anyone&#8217;s guess as to what that actually means. I talked about the silicone earpieces earlier, but forgot to mention that they come in 3 sizes &#8211; small, medium, and large. The Buds come with the small ones installed already, but I found that the mediums were best for me. The earpieces on most of my other earbuds (both wired and wireless) are 99% interchangeable, but these are slightly different. The posts on the ear stems are a slightly smaller diameter than standard, so earpieces from other sets are a bit loose. Swapping other earpieces to the Buds would result in more sound leakage and result in poorer sound quality and bass response, and also put you at a much higher risk of having one of the earpieces coming off the stem and sticking in your ear. Trust me, you don&#8217;t want that. Stick to the 3 sizes provided and find the one that best suits you. Use the biggest size you can stand, because a good seal is critical for good sound quality. Another thing I mentioned briefly was the Buds&#8217; voice notifications. The Buds have a set of pre-programmed voice notifications built in that you&#8217;ll hear as you turn the headset on and off, or change EQ settings, and maybe a few other commands. When you power it up, the headset plays a short musical tune and then a chipper female voice says &#8220;Welcome to the Motorola Buds!&#8221; When you connect to a phone or mp3 player, the same voice says &#8220;Device 1 connected!&#8221; The voice isn&#8217;t too bad, but it took me a while to get used to. When you receive a phone call, it will play another tune at you instead of mirroring your phone&#8217;s ringtone. I think it&#8217;s a riff on the first few notes of &#8220;Ride of the Valkyries&#8221; but I could be wrong. The Buds also play a soft &#8220;bloop&#8221; noise every time you play or pause or adjust the volume. Other than these &#8220;bloop&#8221; noises, there is really no indication of whether or not the unit is even powered up. I mention this because if the headset loses connection it will automatically power down after 5 minutes to save battery. If you pick the headset up after a while and don&#8217;t know what power state it&#8217;s in, hit a volume button and listen for the bloop. The headset has yet to drop Bluetooth connection on its own, which is a first for all the headsets I&#8217;ve owned and is kind of impressive. The very last thing I wanted to talk about (yeah, I made a list) is that there are very thin rubber strips that run up the undersides of each control stalk, which I think serve the purpose of covering the track the wires run through. A small section of one of these strips popped up after about a week and would not seat itself back down. I eventually decided that they are probably held in place by some sort of adhesive, since I could not get it to &#8220;pop back in&#8221;, so I placed the tiniest dab of Krazy Glue in there, wiped off the excess, and held it in place until it dried. This was about a month ago, and it has not popped back up yet.So that&#8217;s absolutely every observation about the Motorola Buds that I&#8217;ve made since I got them. If you&#8217;ve read through all that, I salute you. I probably owe you 20 minutes of your life back. Sorry about that. Now on to the summary, which I promised at the start:For the tl;dr crowd, I wholly approve of this headset. It&#8217;s the headset I&#8217;ve been waiting quite some time for, and it&#8217;s finally here. Features, fit, sound, and looks are all pretty much perfect, and it&#8217;s hard to come up with a list of serious disadvantages. As I write this, it&#8217;s available here for $58, which is quite a steal. The nearest competitor is the LG HBS-800, which normally goes for $130. Check these out &#8211; I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll be disappointed.",5,"The headset I've been waiting for! And YES, it does support the Apt-X codec.

The design of the unit does not lend itself to easy, long-term usage.  It constantly falls off my ear and it is a power hog.  I once got about 2 hours of usage from this device and that remains the record for battery life (Oddly, it takes about two hours to charge this battery from empty).  I am surprised that Motorola couldn't get a better battery or somehow get more usage per charge.The upside is that sound quality is great when you can hear people on the other line (the volume doesn't go up very high).  It's one-push button operation to answer and hang up calls is great.  Though it can sometimes be a little slow to register calls as I have received complaints that it takes me too long to answer the phone.Overall, I like the idea of bluetooth but I haven't found a great headset yet.  I would recommend that you keep shopping around and if you don't find anything else in the price range that you like, buy this one but beware of the limitations.There is one other upside:  I once accidentally used the charger that came with my wife's Motorola V276 phone to charge my headset.

Likewise, you have to scroll through your emails one...line...at...a...time. Why not use the space bar as a quick scroller, like in Outlook?

Although my 11-year-old likes it for its buttons and Gee Whiz value, I find it very awkward to use as a phone.  It doesn't have a normal keyboard, so you must flip the screen up to press the keys, then flip the screen back down to listen and talk.  When you get into a voicemail situation, you have to keep flipping the screen up to ""press 1 for English"", etc.  Very annoying.You also must pay an additional $20 per month if you want to browse the Internet, use Instant Messaging, or even Download Fun.  Otherwise, all you get is phone calls and text messaging (which is also extra).  Even the non-sidekick phones let you get T-Zones for Instant Messaging as a $5.00 option.Another gripe is that the phone is falling apart after two months of not very rough usage.  The screen no longer slips into place when flipped open and the letter ""A"" has fallen out.  It occasionally just freezes for no reason. The first phone I received froze up the first day and had to be replaced.The battery is built into the phone, so you can't take it out to let the phone reset itself.  No such thing as having an extra battery on a trip, for example.Internet browsing is cool, but so slow you think it stopped working.  I think some of the fault is just the slow connection, but the other part of the fault is that the phone seems to take a long time to actually build the web page it's trying to display.Oh, yeah.  Another problem is that T-Mobile expects you to pay $9.95 to set up your album on its web site, then 29 cents for each photo you upload to it.The phone is too large and heavy and has poor quality voice reproduction.  You can't use wallpaper and the ring tones sound terrible.Although it looks good on paper, it isn't really ready for prime time.",2,Awkward to use and unreliable,1109376000,"02 26, 2005"

You can also download limited content.  You can also sync with your Outlook calendar and addressbook, but only if you pay extra for a third-party utiltiy program.  Compared to the original Sidekick, SK II is thinner but quite a bit longer.  I also think it's uglier, esp. the new thumb keyboard, but the keyboard is still very useable.  Battery life is terrible after the first couple weeks, requiring you to carry the charger with you all the time.The problem with the whole T-Mobile data service, though, is the poor quality of T-Mobile's GPRS coverage.  T-Mobile is infamous for its sporadic GSM (voice) coverage in the U.S.  When it comes to GPRS (data), it's even worse, and the slightest degradation in reception will cause the Sidekick to go kaputt.  And when that happens, SK has a tendency to fail to re-establish the data connection when signal strength returns.  This makes a very frustrating user experience, esp. when you need Internet access the most (e.g., when you want to log onto amazon.com to compare-shop that big Sharp Aquos LCD TV you are looking at inside a Best Buy store).  Unfortunately, T-Mobile has not improved its coverage or download speed, so if you get the SK, be prepared for slow speed and lost connections.  Once the novelty factor wears off, the SK experience is a rather stressful one.Of course, currently no other device - not even the Treo 600 - has the same portable form factor and useable keyboard as the SK II.  If you are an absolutely Internet junkie, you'll probably find T-Mobile's abysmal coverage tolerable and SK's true wireless Internet access appealing.",2,"It's the service, stupid",1097020800,"10 6, 2004"

I am a business user, not a Snoop Dog groupie, and this is a VERY cool device.Coverage in my area (Austin, TX is good)and while I have not yet traveled away from the IH-35 corridor, I had good voice and data coverage all the way to the TX/OK stateline (as far north as I went). For $20/month all you can eat data, this is a screaming deal.  I don't find the web surfing that useful (speed is about like a 28kbps dial-up connection) but for email it is superior to the Blackberry 957 I used a number of years ago.  The interface for the phone and for email and the address book is great.  Far better than any Nokia phone I have ever used.  The intellisync software allows me to create use a separate address book in Outlook that I can then sync with the SKII with a one button push.  Very simple and means you can have an abreviated address book if you are concerned about having this infor resident on TMO/Danger's servers.  I agree with another reviewier that it would be better that this info is NOT resident, but if that's a concern, limit what you leave on the server.Drawbacks are no bluetooth, no resident memory for email, pictures etc, no removable memory stick and no easy way to create and use your own ringtones.Great things, great keyboard (nicer/bigger than Crackberry), intuitive interface/software screen size/clarity. Camera a nice feature, easy to email pics anywhere. A very cool and functional device if you need phone and and email.

A1N03V52IRZ5PR,B00063DKVC,"N. J. Simicich ""Gadget Geek""","[16, 23]","I give it five stars - despite some technical problems:You can send and receive vcfs in e-mail attachments - but you can't always file them when you receive them. They are rendered well enough such that you can move the material manually.  This varies - as long as they have a filename that ends in .vcf and a mime type of text/x-vcard or text/directory, and otherwise are formatted correctly, they will get taken. But, some applications, for example, evolution, that great Linux e-mail application, does not give something that was never a file a meaningless filename, so the sidekick will not file evolution's vcards (unless you export them to a file and resend them with the right mime type).Rather than picking the name of the vcard for import out of the vcard's formatting, the sidekick uses the filename. This might mean that it would be simply to pass garbage through the vcf interface, so be careful.You can get URLs in SMS messages and they show up as URLs, but you can't click on them. You can't click on URLs out of the AIM browser - you can copy the text and mail it to yourself, then click on the URLs out of the mail, where it pulls them out and makes them clickable at the end.The documentation says that the phone has a WAP browser. You might say, ""With a regular browser, why would I care about a WAP browser?"" - The answer is bandwidth - you want to look up a phone number, WAP will be faster.  And there are some cool wap games. But the real answer, according to the T-Mobile Tech supervisor is that the WAP browser is vaporware - it does not work.  Maybe someday.  There are sites you can't browse without javascript that have working wap analogues (like microsoft's sms generation site).  So you can't browse them at all from the phone.That is about it.  Most of the rest is great. I moved my Nextel data over by exporting the data from the Nextel site, and, in openoffice, I rearranged the column names to match what would have been exported from Outlook Express, and then imported.  Oh, yes, I also built names with a formula. Saved it as a comma file, just like Outlook had, and, poof, in about a minute, a couple hundred phone numbers, addresses, and names migrated and merged and appeared on my phone.  I could have mailed vcfs for the 70-80 contacts that I was using, but that didn't work.I've resisted all the games (I want MINESWEEPER - yes, I know it is lame).  I might have to drop $4 for solitare.I did drop $10 for the terminal program, and it has already become helpful - the terminal program is wonderful for something on such a tiny device. I can check out servers by connecting to them in raw mode, by port. I can ssh, securely, to my server. There are lots of disconnects, mostly related to when you stop typing to think for a couple of minutes, but a program available in Linux called ""screen"" allows you to save programs running in the background and reconnect to them, see their output, get status, and all that stuff. I can even get on IRC using a character mode IRC client.Someone called me to fix something on a weekend - it was something I could have fixed in 5 minutes on a real terminal, it took eight on the tiny terminal. In many ways, emacs seems to work better than vi does in character mode, but they both work.One secret is that you can log in to your windows box using ssh in character mode using free products from cygwin or SFU (from Microsoft if you have pro). Command line only, sorry.To echo the comments about the AIM client, which is utterly reliable vs. the yahoo client, which drops and reconnects all the time, is probably worthwhile.The documentation suggests that you surf with graphics off for speed. But many buttons are graphical and, unlike every other character or graphics off browser that simply displays the alt text, or, if there is none, ""[IMAGE]"", the button completely goes away, which means that you can't access what the button points to. This essentially means that you have to leave graphics on to surf.Occasionally, web sites are mis-represented - on eBay, for example, there is an extra entry bubble generated between the search text bubble and the putton you push - if you enter text there (which seems the right place) searches don't work.Despite all these niggling problems, and t-mobile's hapless tech support, I am still giving this device five stars. The astounding thing about a poker playing dog is not that it wags its tail when it has a good hand, but that it can tell that it has a good hand at all.The difference between getting text directions and being able to pull up a map of the area you are in as you drive down the road is wonderful - and then javascript stops you from being able to pull up a turn by turn map as you need it.I did not expect to have something in my hand that would allow me to log in to my system using ssh, browse at all, much less pull up mapquest maps.",5,The Sidekick II does Almost everything....,1102896000,"12 13, 2004"

I needed a new phone and ventured into the local Verizon Wireless store.  I happen upon the LG VX7000 and think...this thing is huge!  I don't need a camera in my phone...but then I pick it up and play around with it.  It's pretty comfortable to hold.  The screen is nice, bright and clear.  I wind up purchasing one from VZW online and when the phone arrives, I put it to the test.This phone so far for me has been terrific! The phone itself is a tad larger than my last T720 but not by much...the main LCD is a nice bright TFT screen.  Included are some wallpapers, 3 ""real"" pics(A Sunset scene, an island scene, and a group of people scene), a Verizon Logo wallpaper and a few ""doodle type"" cartoony pics.  You can change the settings for the display easily, as the UI for this LG is much better than my old Moto.  The front LCD is nice enough...you can also set a wallpaper here or use a pic taken from the camera to use as a picture ID when that person calls.Ringtones...kinda forgettable (I am beginning to think cell phone providers tell phone makers to make some pretty useless ringers so you download decent ones).  You can however, record your own which sound surprisingly good with the internal mic, as well as download them from Verizon's Get It Now Brew service.  You can also, use MP3's as ringtones through a little trick.  One think I like...this phone is loud!!  I can hear it ringing in a crowded shopping mall even.  The vibrate feature works well enough and can be activated quickly (though this requires you to flip open the phone).The camera is located where the ""hinge"" of the flip would be and rotates so you can snap a pic of yourself without contorting your face and arms to face the lens.  You can also change some pic settings like black and white and sepia tones, etc.  The camera is quite decent for a VGA cell phone camera.  There is a flash though this is rather useless except for close up pics.  The camera also lets you take 15 sec video clips which you can save and email to your friends.  While I figured I'd never use this feature, I have twice already.  The advantages of having the camera/video in something you always carry is quite nice...it's fine for candid moments and though your friends might know you have a camera phone, they won't probably guess you're video recording them. :DThe call quality is nice,loud, and clear...much better than my old cell phone.

Since I haven't done a baseline test of the phone with other bluetooth headsets, I can't say if it is the headset or the phone, but either way, if you buy one of these and have the same problem, make sure and return it within the return period.Another problem is the plastic ear holder (the part that holds the headset to your ear). This is a bad design and honestly, there is no way to get this thing to properly and confortably fit my ear. The only way to wear it is to have half your ear lobe hanging out, which result in a lot of pain within 10min or so. Avoid this headset if you want wear a headset for extended periods of time.A final note: The wind blocking technology works well, but at the expense of a high quality sound transmission to your recipent.

It recently had no problems keeping up with a four hour Skype session!It is also capable of pairing with multiple devices, so you can for instance use it with your computer at home and your cell phone on the road without having to redo the pairing every time, something cheap brand-X headsets don't do.Logitech was kind enough to supply a very tiny charger, perfect if you take your headset on the road. For those international trips, no problem: it can handle 100 to 240 volts and 50 to 60 Hz (translation for the technologically challenged: you can use it anywhere in the world, just get a cheap prong adapter)On the negative side, it's possible to jam the connector into the headset the wrong way if you're not careful. Of course the battery won't charge up and the light won't go on, a dead giveaway. It caused no damage to my headset, but the connector design could be better.I found this headset very comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. The volume is loud and the sound quality is very clear. People on the other side liked the sound quality as well.There are a few negative points that cost this otherwise excellent headset a star:* after 10 minutes of inactivity, it goes to low-power mode ""sleep"". When the phone it is paired with rings, it may take up to 5 rings for it to wake up and start ringing. If you press the answer button before the headset starts ringing, you will lose the call. If you want to answer right away, you can always answer on the phone but if you do so pressing the answer button on the headset will not transfer the call to the headset like it did on my Sony Ericsson HBH headset, but hang up. To transfer the call to the headset, use the appropriate menu on the phone instead.* The ring on the headset is an irritating, non-modifiable melody. It would be nice to have a few options!* The headset is fairly large and dorky-looking.Despite these few drawbacks, don't forget that this is a very capable, well made and reliable headset at a bargain basement price, one of the best out there.

I wanted to use a wireless headset and VoIP to make international calls, mostly from hotel rooms. This headset did not work out of the box for my situation. The Logitech support website was great. It said to upgrade the notebook's bluetooth software. The HP site was also excellent. I downloaded bluetooth and many other newer drivers. Once installed, the headset immediately worked as docuemented. The other newer drivers solved all the weird hibernation problems I've been experiencing too. I'm using Skype for VoIP service. Skype setup has an option for using the bluetooth headset for Skype only, otherwise the normal audio devices are used. All in all, installation was a bit of upgrade work but competently supported. I now have a VoIP connected wireless headset that allows me mobile freedom. Due to my usage, I have no comment on the audio quality or useability with mobile phones. The device apparently will not work with the majority of PocketPCs due to a lack of bluetooth software. Thus I only gave it 4 stars. However, HP does sell stereo headphones (no microphone) for most IPaq models.Update: 15-March-2005 Am able to pair with Axim x50v PocketPc. Has considerable static.

I have tried every brand of BT headset you can imagine, I mean EVERY brand.  I was so frustrated to a point I was ready to go back to wired headset until I ran into this little guy.  This is by far the best one, hands down.  My most miserable experence was with Jabra and Motorola.  I had a lot of connection and audio quality issues with those brands.BT headset designers seem to favor visual appeal rather than performance.  I don't understand by most headsets on the market are short and stubby, in which the microphone is right next to your ear instead of your month.  Having microphone that far away results in having to turn up the microphone sensitivity, which cause the headset to pick up everything including background noise.  Lack of an effective noise-filtering system such as the one in this Logitech headset, you end up with wind noise, car noise, AC noise, every kind of noise but your voice.  In additional, the close promixity between the speak and microphone creates a feedback loop for a nice serving of constant echoing.  I lost count of the occasions when my friends and coworkers on the other end of the phone tell me to ""get off your crappy Jabra BT headset"" or ""take me off your Motorola BT headset"".  I am amazed that people on the other end can easily tell it's a Jabra BT headset because the horrid sound quality.Onto this gem, the sound quality is amazing, by far the best of the bunch.  The WindStop system really does work.  Together with the farther extending microphone, this unit produce the best sound both incoming and outgoing.  I know many users complaining about the fit, but it's really a fault of the user.  As one reviewer pointed out, there is a ""correct"" way to wear this, and I think it provides an excellent fit and comfort.I can't speak for all, but I personally don't wear a BT headset as a fashion statement.  I use it as a mean for convenience and safety, so sound quality and fit are top factors for my consideration.  On that note, this is a clear winner.  I wish product managers and designers at Motorola and particularly Jabra take note of that.  Jabra (250 and 250v models) being the worst with it's behind the ear design and a heavy-trigger button is really a very lousy product in terms of usability and sound quality.

Depending on your phone's angle and the conformation of the receiver, it may work or not. My phone is a Toshiba digital phone and I was able to get this to work only by angling the phone almost horizontally, which makes it look stupid on my desk and also makes it hard to read the LCD and caller ID.Installing it is a bit twitchy, as you have to temporarily mount it somehow on the side of the phone as you play with where it is to sit, and if it's angled correctly. That's because the stickum adhesive is pretty permanent, so you have to decide the optimum  placement before you attach it. I had to resort to duct tape for this step.I'm going to be frank and say I have a love-hate (maybe mostly hate) relationship with Plantronics equipment. I go through headsets lately like nobody's business. My first one lasted 10 years! That was excellent.

Had I not needed Bluetooth to work with my new Toyota Prius, I'd have stuck with the i500. In fact, if Samsung/Sprint had released the i550 (SD memory slot, faster, etc.) I would have never considered the Treo 650.  So, let's talk about the positives of the 650:Camera w/movies is nice.  Memory card slot is nice.  It's fast. Bluetooth sync with my Mac Powerbook is awesome - no more plugging up cables to HotSync! Handfree in the Prius works great. Having a PalmOS 5 based machine gives a more powerful web browser that can view more sites. Higher rez screen is nice.On the downside, the lack of graffiti would be okay if this keyboard was as good as the one in the old Motorola PageWriter, but instead, it's as small as they could make it, requiring shift-keys to get to slashes, @ symbols, numbers, etc. A real hassel and even though I could blaze on the PageWriter, I've been reduced to about half the speed on this keyboard due to all the extra work.  Having software-graffiti would have been nice, and the third-party add-on ""write on screen"" apps are okay, but not as accurate as what my 6035 or i500 had.No voice recognition at all, but for $20 you can get a program that is awesome and doesn't have to be trained.  ""Call 5 5 5 1 2 1 2"" and it does.  ""Call Bob Tompson Mobile"" and it matches it to the address book -- no training, beyond numbers. VERY NICE.Battery life is so-so.  You have to charge it each day if you use the 'net much. i500 was poor, too, but better than this.  The 6035 I could use for almost a week without charging it!  (6035 and i500 had analog modes, too, while the 650 is digital only.)So, it's okay, I'm okay with it, it crashes/reboots randomly all the time, but ... there's really no other option on Sprint.I would have taken a flip phone over this huge brick phone in a heartbeat...

It is a dramatic improvement and I love it.The screen is now high res and looks incredibly clear, the Bluetooth works wonderfully with the wireless Jabra headset. When a call comes in simply hit answer on the phone and the call comes through the headset. I don't particularly like the comfort fit of the Jabra on my ear so I will probably be looking at other alternatives as well.The camera is now actually good enough to take snapshots you would keep. Almost as good as some of the low end digital cameras.  A few of the critical buttons are placed more intuitively.Initial setup went pretty smoothly, so far, it seamlessly upgraded my old Treo 600 software and imported all my contacts and calendar as well as almost all my applications.  The Sprint phone rep that activated my phone actually seemed to be quite knowledgable.The only real CON is that the Treo 650 Hotsync cable connector is big and clunky compared to 600. IMHO they made a backward step by replacing the sleek original Treo connector with the Tungsten design connector. It requires a separate power supply to charge.  I have been used to charging my Treo 600 through the single USB hotsync cable to my laptop.  This extra power connection is a messy annoyance.  The upside is that since the battery is removable I can have a spare charging elsewhere.Overall opinion is that I wouldn't even consider returning to or buying a Treo 600 now that the Treo 650 is available.",5,A must get upgrade to the Treo 600!,1101427200,"11 26, 2004"

But I do wish the Treo 600 can be better!I had the Treo 600 for almost 1 year and upgraded to Treo 650 as soon as PalmOne asked me to that's because Parts of my prayer has been answered: A better screen resolution; touch screen is more sensitive than the 600, I use my finger instead of the stylus now; camera is a lot clearer and the zoom works great; removable battery is really handy to use that fully charged spare one any time; my favorite bluetooth is built-in. And that little keyboard lites up in bright blue and white is very easy to read. Thanks to the faster processor, the program loads a lot faster.However, I am still looking for the built-in WiFi, and the bluetooth does not take voice command; reboot is not as easy as Treo 600. I do not notice the boot up being slow because I rarely have to. However, I did notice that it takes up more internal memory and thus make the available ram less than 10MB the first time I turned it on. (Palm is doing a flash upgrade to fix this, so I heard.) With an SD card, I put a bunch of application on it to get around this until it get fixed. And I was able to have about 18MB available internally.I like this new Treo 650, as to all my handheld gadgets, I bought a fitted case to protect it. If you like me want to keep everything in perfectly nice looking condition, I recommad a case and a screen protector. Remember, this is a hefty investment comparable to a PC, this Treo 650 may even be your home phone, make sure it is well-protected.",4,"Still, a big improvement over the treo 600",1103587200,"12 21, 2004"
A3QYIBMXQVLVE7,B0006FLA80,G. Crain,"[66, 71]","I have had this phone almost 6 weeks (40 days).  At 3 weeks the middle row of keys stopped working (a, s, d, f, and g, etc).  I was told to call Palm in India, which I did, and they told me the keys were not covered under warranty.I truly wish I were making this up, because I have really loved Palm.  This is my fourth Palm device, though it will likely be my last.  I run a small real estate company which works with wireless telecom providers throughout the nation.  My hope for this device was that I could stop carrying three devices (my cell phone, my Palm T3 and my laptop).  And then, that all my guys could stop carrying all these devices around.Of course, when I took the phone to Sprint, they said it was Palm's responsibility to repair.  When I raised a stink with them they just looked at me with blank eyes, as they always do.  Sprint seems like they are in the business of trying to run customers off.I called India back and raised enough of a stink, that they said they would give me - this one time - a ""free return and repair,"" meaning I would be without my phone for 5-10 business days. They also gave me the option of paying them an additional $25 to get a refurbished replacement, complete with a 90-day warranty (which I now know means nothing).  These people honestly acted like they were doing me the biggest favor by offering me this repair.I was then effectively called a liar by Palm / India when I had to re-emphasize that the keys just don't work, and that I needed something immediately.  I don't understand how I can be made to feel like a criminal when I deal with these people, or how I can be made to feel like they're doing me a favor by standing behind their product.  I am the customer!  Doesn't that mean anything anymore?I am also not sure I understand how customer service in general has become so bad (though Amazon's remains very, very good).  When a person spends $400 on a phone, or any device, it should work longer than a few weeks.  But when it does stop working, the company that sold it should stand behind their product, instead of looking for ways to squirrel out of their responsibility.  Subsequent to this occurrence, other friends / colleagues have told me how they had problems with their Treo 650s, as well.There are other issues with this phone.  Out of the box, the power/sync cord did not work.  I returned that to Sprint and got a tremendous hassle in trying to get it replaced.  (I ended up buying a Seidio charger/cradle, which works fine.) The sound is pretty bad - I am constantly having to adjust the volume.  Every so often, the phone just resets itself - can't figure this one out at all.  Also, when someone calls in on Call-Waiting, you cannot disconnect your active call without disconnecting the incoming call; in other words, when you accept the Call-Waiting call, it automatically means two calls will run simultaneously, even when the first party hangs up.  This plays heck on your monthly minutes.Also, there are limited, non-intuitive ways you have to power on the phone.  And don't get this phone for its camera: cell phone cameras are only good for placing pictures on that cell phone.Otherwise, all the Palm applications work as they should, and as they have for the past number of years.  Expect nothing new and different from the Palm OS part of the Treo.All in all, I am firm in my opinion that I will never own another Palm device.  My company will stop using Palm, and we are going to slowly migrate away from Sprint (when contracts start to expire).My apologies for the rant, but it simply seems that these companies have become much bigger than their customers.  Excuse me if I just let them move on without me.Are there any companies out there that provide good customer service anymore?

I've always resisted buying a combined device, because I thought ""they aren't ready yet.""  When it came time to replace my PDA, I decided that the Treo 650 might be ready.  I had concerns about the size of the screen, and about integrating PDA and cell phone functions.  Overall, most of my nervousness about it was groundless.  I am pleased with the phone so far.Good points:Works well as a phone--Better signal than the Nokia phone it replacesScreen is very readable, even though it is smaller than on a traditional PDAPalm functionality is fine.  The interface has been redesigned a bit, and you seldom need the stylus.  Most entries are done with the rocker switch at bottom center of the screen, or with the keypad.  You truly can do many functions one-handed.  But they managed to do this without losing the feel of the Palm, you aren't having to re-learn from zero.The memory is non-volatile--In English, this means that if your batteries go dead, you don't lose all your data till you re-synch your Palm.Bad points:Those who complain about a slight delay when dialing from a number in the Palm contacts list are right.  It's not really a problem, but it is an annoying couple of second delay.If you are one of those who read books on Palms, I'm not sure the screen will do for prolonged reading.Battery life is fair.  I am able to get two days out of it with medium use, and have a bit of life left in the battery.  Not like the days of the monochrome Palms when you'd go for a week between recharges!It's only so-so as a web browser.The price is hideously high.Keyboard is cramped, but about as good as you can expect on such a small device.  It is definitely useable.  My instinct was to use my right thumb only, but I now believe the people who claim that if you use both hands (thumbs only) you'll be faster.From what I've seen of the Treo 600, I do not believe the upgrade would be worth it for those who currently own a 600.

My experience was specific to using the Scala with Sprint's LG-PM325.First, the audio quality was not good.  If my phone was lying on a piece of furniture within two feet of the headset, I could usually get passable quality and occassionally get clear reception.  Any other scenario resulted in garbled audio.  When using the headset with my phone, while the phone was in my front pocket, the audible was unacceptable and barely discernable.  And it's not by hearing.Second, there's the shiny blue light.  When I read other's comments about the flashing blue LED, I really didn't think much of it.  But in the dark, this thing is a strobe light.  At night, with my headset left on some countertop downstairs, and while I was upstairs, I could see the flash of blue reflected off my second story ceiling.  That's part A.

This never happens with the Scala 500.  Additionally, volume is easily regulated.Pairing with the Motorola MPX220 phone was quick and easy.  Additionally, reconnect is quick and reliable following a disconnect due to powering off one of the units or going out of range.

A1VL6XFRL2NALY,B0006HES2I,"Tony P ""Tons""","[7, 8]","Ok. I just bought this adapter today for my PDA cellphone.  The product integrates well with everything (My Laptop - sony vaio, cellphone (siemens sx56, my panasonic cordless home phone (although with the panasonic, ppl complain about my voice being faint)).  But the issue is , I hear static crackling noises even if I'm not in a call. As soon as my bluetooth headset is connected to the a210 adapter, it produces faint-medium crackling noise. The noise is exactly like the one it produces when you move out of range.  But happens even at 1-2 feet distance.  I was initially confused on what is producing this.  The battery was fully charged on the adapter.  The bluetooth headset is not the issue, as it connects well with my laptop (which has integrated bluetooth).  Then I figured, if I keep the adapter and phone closer (few inches away from my ear) to my headset, then everything works well. Otherwise even at a distance of 2-3 feet , it starts the crackling.  I even switched modes (1,2,3) on the adapter and still the same issue.  Although it works upto 20-25 feet, the crackling starts at a distance of 2 feet.  I even turned off my wireless networks to test this.  Also exchanged it for a new one, to see if it was a item specific issue.  But even the 2nd one is having the same problem.  The manual says, that it is due to interference.  I think many 2.4 Ghz can cause this inteference.  Alhtough I turned off all of my wireles devices, it still caused the issue even in my car (slightly better, but not totally gone).But in any case if you don't hear the crackling, it integrates very well with everything.  The crackling is heard only by you, not by the person on the other side.  So we can probably live with it.  There are not many bluetooth adapters that are available out there.Note: Many reviewers here complain about this adpater not working well with home phones.  First of all, if you read the manual, this is not designed to work with home phones (if it works well with home phones, then you're lucky).

Given its low price, though, it's a great value, though I can see why some RAZR and PEBL boxes include this for *free*. My report card:Design: A-, nice simple design. Buttons are few and easy to use, though the main button is a bit sensitive. Single-tap to power-on  is a welcome feature. USB charging a real plus.Aesthetics: A-, it's attractive in its minimalist aesthetic. Color options are cool. (And there more of then if you shop elsewhere!)Build quality: A, it's a solid unit with good materials.Comfort: B+, it's lightweight with a decent ear clip. Unfortunately, the earclip is loose on the headset which, combined with the light weight, make for a very ""floppy"" fit.Compatibility: A, no problems pairing. Connects quickly when turned on. Headset has full handsfree functionality that is very easy to use.Outbound sound quality: B, callers can hear me fairly well, but many have complained of a pronounced ""speakerphone"" effect requiring some self-repeating. OK noise cancellation.Inbound sound quality: B+, volume is more than adequate, but could be a tad bit louder still for noisy environments. Incoming voices are clear but could use some bass. Minimal static.PS: A previous reviewer believed that, like the HS850 with its folding mic boom (the on/off and connection switch), you need only turn on the H500 when receiving a call; the headset would connect quickly with the phone and pick up the call. THIS IS FALSE.

(Plus, the price for an ""upgrade phone"" for Nextel was *unacceptable* from my point of view.  Everyone knows you get a cheaper phone with a new contact!)I got two RAZR's at a local retailer - sorry Amazon, but your rebates with Cingular aren't worth the effort - and paid $99 each, best price *anywhere.*  I got a family plan which is on par with Verizon's and saves me a bunch of money over Nextel.  A *bunch* of money.  Two words: rollover minutes.I spent just an hour charging the phone, reading the manual and configuring the phone to function as well, if not better, than my i730, which is a *great* phone, and noticed similarities in function and detail and quality to Sony, Motorola and Nokia phones friends of mine have.  I repeat: I read some of the manual, which is something many people seem to avoid.For anyone complaining about the phone/ address book, shame on you.  I was worried about the address book based on reviews, but after five minutes with the manual and using the phone, I got the RAZR to do *everything* my nifty i730 could do and then some.  There are so many ways to configure the address book it's silly.  You can assign and create ""categories""  for numbers and addresses and even have the phone only display certain categories so you only have to flip thru the numbers you want to flip thru.As for the complaints about battery life, the RAZR has a six-plus hour talk time on it, better than half the phones on the market today.  I can say that cos I feel like I've researched about half the phones on the market ... :)  Do this: plug your phone in when you go to sleep at night.  I can *guarantee* you it will be fully charged in the morning.Fragile phone? How clumsy are you?  I've beaten up lots of phones over the years and you should expect just about anything this side of a brick to break when you drop it.  Half of my i730 is made of the same material the RAZR is and has a lousier belt clip to boot, which has allowed my i730 to fall the the ground way too many times.  I'm happy with the material and it's expected durability.  Stop throwing your delicate, *expensive,* micro-electronic device around like it's made of teflon.  *Be careful.*I am not on the camera-phone bandwagon primarily because what is required to merge unlike technologies is by it's nature usually expensive and difficult.  (A good example is the ROKR, the so-called iTunes phone.  I have an iPod, and if that phone had come close to actually blending the best of the wireless world and the abilities of iTunes and the iPod,I would have bought it, but it came far short of doing that cos blending two ideas like that isn't the easiest thing to pull off well ...) The RAZR is not expensive because it has a great camera or a large memory stick or can capture full-motion video and zip it over to your dorm room buddies in the blink  of an eye.  It's expensive because it's a *slick* looking phone and makes other phones on the shelf self-conscious.  Most of the professional reviews of this phone gave it low marks for camera abilities, so don't be surprised by that.  Want a good camera phone for Cingular? The Sony s710 got great reveiws; good luck getting it for less than twice what the RAZR costs.  That's the difference.Last thing - I got the phone knowing I have 30 days to send the whole thing back if it's not working out for me.  So there's a little consumer-friendly cushion to give me some time to fully evaulate the phone.  Still, I did my research so there wouldn't be too many surprises when I got the phone.Hope this helps.",4,Lovely phone - get what you pay for... !,1126828800,"09 16, 2005"

All the features are the same.Razr has a big huge color screen, bluetooth enabled and can capture videos. But there is no improvement on any of the calling features.So if you are getting the phone free after the rebates you can buy it, else it is not worth the $200.",3,"Nothing extraordinary, mainly a lot of hype around the looks",1129334400,"10 15, 2005"
A39KJOCZGCM8P1,B0006I2E1O,Chris Lee Mullins,"[37, 38]","I'll start with the bad first, given the amount of interest this phone has generated.1) The Phonebook application is a little...wonky. Some people have said you can't add more than one piece of contact info per contact, which is NOT true. You can, but its nearly hidden underneath the ""MORE"" function while editing the contact. However, its not convenient and you cannot add additional e-mail addresses or phone numbers to your contacts using the Phone Tools app...which is annoying, since T-Mobile charges $30-40 for the hardware/software bundle.1a) It also takes forever to scroll through your Phonebook contacts. I thought it MIGHT be caused by having some SIM contacts, so I transfered all of them to phone memory. No dice. The scroll speed is untenable. Even my wife's Moto V330 is quicker. What gives? I had to create a voice prompt for almost every contact in my list.2) Even at full blast, the volume just isn't loud enough. Plus, the ""audio sweet spot"" on the speaker is hard to keep next to your ear. If you are planning to get a Bluetooth headset and use that exclusively, this shouldn't keep you from getting the phone.3) Compared to a Samsung V205, a Sony Ericsson P910i and Motorola's own V330, the RAZR gets poorer reception. The previous phones mentioned all get four bars at my house. The RAZR gets 2. This even after calling T-Mobile tech support for help. Their advice? ""Keep turning the phone on and off and it will hopefully find another tower.""4) T-Mobile offers NO games for this phone yet. Given how high profile this form factor has become, I find this level of support to be somewhat poor. I know - you don't buy a phone for its games. But just to show how lacking T-Mobile's support is...the RAZR includes a demo for BeJeweled. After the (very) short demo is over, it asks if you want to buy it. Clicking the link brings you to a webpage that says ""Sorry, we don't offer games for your phone yet"". My wife's V330 has a similar issue. She's had it for over 4 months and services like T-Mobile STILL offer no games for the phone. Again, I know you shouldn't buy a phone based on the number of games offered for it, but its still a feature, something to whittle away the time while waiting at the DMV.5) Camera phone still only 640x480. Decent pics at that resolution, but given that there are cheaper phones on the market (I didn't get this phone for free) with higher pixel values, this is a moderate oversight on Moto's part6) Phone response is fairly poor as well. Example - going through my contacts by pressing keys (going from Q to R to S)...so very slow. You think the phone hasn't responded so you mash the button again, at which point it responds to TWO button presses and you have to start all over again.7) The Phone Tools application is a little user unfriendly and totally geared to people who mess around with Outlook CSVs on a daily basis. I've managed to get it to work, but not without some work.Alright, so now for the good.1) This phone is a veritable conversation piece. Oohs and ahhs all around...if you care about that sort of thing. I usually don't. I just want a functional phone that gets good battery life, gets a decent signal and can withstand a beating (I'm a klutz). But if you do care about the conversation-worthyness of your cell phone, this one has it in spades.2) Great battery power. I've had it on for 5 days at moderate usage and I've still got 2 bars left.3) This is a sturdy phone. My kid has already dropped it on cement twice and I've seen NO scratches at all. Maybe I'm lucky, as another reviewer mentioned that poor build quality on his piece. I've not had any issues. The phone is rock solid.4) The usual amount of ringtones and wallpapers....all of which are amazingly expensive. Why does it cost 2 bucks for a hi-fi ringtone lasting 20 seconds when I can buy the song at iTunes for a dollar?5) The PhoneTools software allows you to create your OWN ringtones. I haven't played around with the software yet, so I'm going to guess that your abilities to import MP3s or CD-audio will be truncated to some degree.6) Excellent Bluetooth performance. Haven't had the opportunity to test file transfers and such, but the RAZR's connection to my Moto BT headset is great. Doesn't matter which side of my body they are situated. Decent sound quality even at 20 feet of unobstructed space.7) Did I mention this phone is attractve?8) Ringtones can get quite loud, even without degrading ringtone sound quality. I wish the speaker was this loud.This phone has some serious shortcomings - most important among them is the poor performance of the Phonebook app, poor signal quality and low speaker volume. Ordinarily, I'd be bringing the phone back, like, tomorrow. But the design of the phone and its excellent BT performance makes me want to hang onto it.Hopefully, Moto learns from their mistakes and releases a RAZR V4 with better earpiece volume and snappier response times.",3,Great looking phone....if yer into that sort of thing,1125100800,"08 27, 2005"

Let's face it - for guys who don't like to keep the phone on their belt like a pager, a pants or suit pocket is the only option.  This phone is far and away the best one in that regard.  I forget it's there a lot of the time.  It is also built EXTREMELY solidly, and does NOT scratch easily, although the SCREEN scratches easily.However, the battery life is terrible.  I literally have to charge it every night after less than two hours of talking with bluetooth.  You MUST get the car charger immediately.  Even though I had bought one on the internet, I couldn't wait for it because the phone kept dying so I raced to a local cingular store for an intermediate car cord.The Motorola HS-850 BT headset is great but occassionally loses connection w/the phone, which is frustrating.The only reason I kept this phone is the size.",3,WARNING - ROTTEN BATTERY LIFE!

Motorola got the form exactly right, just slightly larger than a credit card, and only a half an inch thick. The screen is excellent.Motorola missed big time on this one, not including Motorola Phone Tools and a USB cable in the purchase - now how cheap is that. I just spent all that money on a super exclusive cool phone, and they make me buy software for $30? That's actually kind of crazy.They also messed up on the phone book. 450 Outlook contacts, that were spawned from 200 core contacts - each cell phone, business, email, and home entry for an individual is a separate entry. Way way too unwieldy. They need to update this error big time. They've also missed on priority numbers - you know, you identify people you call a lot, and they go to the head of the list. I'm used to the problems now, but wow what a miss on their part.The camera, oh it takes pictures. They look decent on the cell phone, but forget much more. The shutter speed must be very slow, you have to hold the phone solid to not get blurry pictures (when viewed on a computer screen full size) - on the phone they look great.Overall - my nits are truely nits, this is one heck of a great phone.

A952LJOXPLTVL,B0006I2E1O,"K. Allen ""Cram34""","[46, 55]","I bought this becasue I was very happy to see a phone with a metal case again.  I used to just use nokia phones back in the day and they would break at least once a month on me.  Bought the Moto v60 and was really blown away.  The best phone I ever had.  Then I upgraded to color phones and tried the other Motos.  Really big disapointment.  Moto phones are made so cheap and fall apart just like nokia.  When this came out I jumped on it.  Finally Moto was going back to the quality phones.PROS:-Some what sturdy case.  The metal parts seem solid. No marks as of yet (1 month).-The battery life is a little tiny bit higher then your average phone.  I have to charge it at night but it has at least half the life left on it.  I talk for about 3 hours a day.-Camera is ok not the best and by far not the worst.-Slim form factor.  And yes its wider then your normal flip but this is a good size.  Other phones always seemed to skinny for me.CONS:-Not all of it is metal.  The bottom is plastic and it seems to be cheap plastic.  It creaks when you push on it.  I think that is where the antenna is, and if it has a SAR rating of .80 (I think) at the ear then I wonder how much your jaw is getting.  Rather my jaw get cancer then my brain right?-The vol is almost a joke it is so low.  At the highest its about what a normal phone is at its middle setting.  I used to have to turn people down on my cell, now I am struggling to hear them sometimes.-The keypad looks nice but its a pain in the butt.  The donut thing in the middle is already scracthed by my finger nail.  The rest of the keypad is protected it seems and has no marks.-A pain to clean.  The keypad is shiny and gets crap all over it.  When you clean it the rubber lining between the keys grabs part of what ever cloth you are using and gets it looking even worse.-Phone book.  Good god man.  The fact that they used this phone book really shows that either they don't put a lot of effort into the phone or was a total mess up.  Either way it is a true shame.-Good luck with support and warranty from Moto.  Past experiences with them was very poor.  You send your phone to get fixed and a month later you get it back and they didn't even read what the problem was before they ""fix"" it and send it back still broken.The reason they make phones out of cheap plastic in my opinion is because what do you do 6 months after your phone looks like you dropped it down the stairs a few dozen times.  You buy another.  Strong durable plastic is used all the time.  For crying out loud Glad uses it all the time.  I am more then happy to pay 600 dollars on quality and if you have the money do the same.  This phone is not even close to meeting my expectations of what I thought I would get for a 600 dollar ""basic"" cell phone.  I have high standards and for top dollar I want the best.  Moto might be seeing this and is offering good rebates now. 250 or something on Amazon as of now.  Well worth it for that price.To the other reviewer about Verizon.  They use CDMA and this phone is only for GSM.  I doubt they will ever make a CDMA version.  But of course I have no real clue.  Call Motorola.Also sorry for my spelling mistakes and all.  It would take to much time to go back and review what I wrote.  I am not getting paid for this and won't waste my time.

Blows the i830 out the water and makes it look like yesterdays news. Superior and striking good looks and is solidly built - no, it does not look cheap as some previous reviewer stated. I live in GA and Cingular reception is very good. Paired my v3 with Bluetrek G2 bluetooth headset(received rave reviews and is cheap - pick one up on ebay) and I wonder what took me so long to get on board.

A3JMO0ET6611HV,B0006I2E1O,"M.D. ""mdoan300""","[40, 45]","Sexy form... CHECK. Innovative construction... CHECK. Exclusive price tag... CHECK. In a sea of flip phones and candy bar phones that all look alike, the RAZR V3 is the Ferrari of mobile phones and stands out as such. If you're looking for a feature rich phone, then the V3 is not for you as a V600 will provide the same features for far less. But if you want a high-quality constructed phone that screams, &#34;look at me, I'm a sexy b*tch,&#34; then the V3 is up your alley.Actually, a better analogy would be: The Acura NSX of mobile phones. Like the NSX, I feel the V3 is a marketing tool for Motorola. It's their way of saying, &#34;We're known for inexpensive phones, but, look, we can build stylish, well-crafted, high-end phones too!&#34;Unless wireless technology improves from GSM, the V3 is a phone that I can definitely keep for more than 2 years. The styling, design, and construction is just that good (I upgraded from a trusty and reliable, yet mediocre Nokia 3360 TDMA phone).There's been quite a debate about the construction of the V3 and the best explanation that I've heard is that the bottom backside (below the battery cover) and the lower front is plastic for the antenna. It certainly makes perfect sense to me (unless the metal frame IS the antenna) as all the other areas are cold to touch (in this weather) while those areas are usually room temperature. Furthermore, it would be misrepresentation on Motorola's part to advertise it as such. Regardless, this phone may seem flimsy, but it's very solid -- there is no comparison w/ my old Nokia 3360 and my girlfriend's V551.Mikey's likeys:1- The mini-USB port. This is great for single-point access for data and charging -- it's simple and should be a mobile phone standard!2- The Bluetooth connectivity. Coming from a wired hands-free setup, my Bluetooth headset (a Jabra BT250) is a godsend. I can leave the V3 charging in my home office and still be connected in the living room. (SIDE NOTE: stay away from from the D-Link Bluetooth USB adapter for PC connectivity and get the Belkin F8T001 adapter -- read my review on the D-Link for details)3- Quad band. Doubtful that I'll ever use this feature/benefit, but those two words will certainly impress all around you.4- The speakerphone. I've been a non-believer of mobile phone speakerphones, but I've got to admit, the V3's speaker phone is the bomb. It's loud and clear (but not loud enough for the car). My girlfriend tells me that I sound better w/ the V3 speakerphone than w/ my old Nokia 3360 and wired headset setup. When I don't have my Bluetooth headset, I'm spoiled w/ the speakerphone.5- The internal display. Going to the V3 from the Nokia 3360 is a leap of spacial proportions and after a couple of weeks, I have found myself to be spoiled w/ large internal display. And not only that, the V3 has an ATI IMAGEON graphics accelerator! All other phones (excluding PDA phones) pale in comparison in this regard.Mikey's no-likeys:1- No memory expansion. I don't see myself using up all 5MB of internal memory, but an SD/MMC card expansion slot would be nice. Maybe Motorola (or somebody else -- maybe myself) will come out w/ a mini-USB adapter for this purpose.2- Poorly written owner's manual. I have found that the owner's manual is more like a reference manual and sometimes leaves you figuring things out on your own. It does not explain how to use many common features that owners (especially ones new to Motorola phones) use. Instead, it lists all the features and expects you to put 1 and 1 together. It's like the &#34;C++ Reference&#34; vs &#34;Learn How to Program in C++ in 21 Days.&#34; Maybe Motorola's technical writers are just to technical?3- Drops and dings. Like any &#34;Ferrari,&#34; I'll probably go into a week-long mourning the first time I drop or ding the phone. I'm hoping there will be [good] cases available to protect my V3 while it juggles around w/ keys in my pocket. (SIDE NOTE: I have heard that Cingular / Lockline is not insuring this phone, but my Cingular sales guy was hesitant sell me the phone unless I bought the insurance)4- No EDGE. My girlfriend's $99 Motorola v551 has EDGE. Shame, shame, shame Motorola. Bad Motorola. Bad, bad, bad. Alas, it's akin to buying a $160k Ferrari 360 Modena and having a cheap $20 factory stereo system (or paying $90k for an Acura NSX and it's only 290hp).5- Internal display colors. I was all hyped up to hear about 260k colors, but Motorola's specs after some detective footwork is 65k colors, but up to 260k colors in MPEG-4 video playback. Very, very, sneaky and mis-leading indeed.Wishlist:1- I wished there was a PocketPC smart phone version of this phone. PocketPC + V3 form factor = perfection.Regarding multiple numbers for one name in the review below -- you can set the phonebook to display only primary numbers by:1- setting the primary number for all the names that have multiple numbers (you don't have to do this if a name only has one number);2- set the address book view to &#34;Primary Contacts&#34; in Phonebook Menu &#62;&#62;&#62; Phonebook Setup &#62;&#62;&#62; View;3- voila, only primary numbers are displayed.The way Motorola has implemented this is not very intuitive as Nokia's implementation (refer to my owner's manual dis-like above), but I have found Motorola's implementation to be a little more robust.UPDATE: It's been nearly three weeks since I've bought this phone and no buyer's remorse.",5,The Ferrari of Mobile Phones,1100995200,"11 21, 2004"
AYW1TGDCP2OK6,B0006I2E1O,MestaySS,"[0, 0]","I've had this phone for a while now and here's what I think.The User Interface has had a bad rap from some people, and yes, it's not as intuitive as say, Nokia's interface, but it does have some pros.  You can customize every button, including all 4 arrows, and the left and right soft keys.  I have my left soft key programmed to go to ""Shortcuts"" and I have every function I need right there.  And of course, after a while of use, you will get used to the interface.The volume of the phone is decent.  I have no problems hearing other people, and they have no problems hearing me.  Speakerphone works great too.  My boyfriend says that he no longers feels like he's talking to someone in a tunnel when I use speakerphone for our calls.  The only volume problem I can see is that at the highest volume (7), it is still slightly hard to hear your phone ring.  One other thing - this phone has way cool ringtones.The address book issue is this:  If you use your SIM card to store your addresses, then no, you will not be able to have multiple entries for one person.  But if you use your phone's memory to store your numbers, you can have many many numbers stored to each entry.  I have all of my numbers stored on my Powerbook's address book, so I'm not too worried about having them on my SIM card.  And if you have a MAC, iSync works wonders with syncing numbers/calendars to the RAZR....now THAT'S cool!The screen is very large and clear.  I have no problems seeing it in dark or even bright light.  I have had no problems with reception with Cingular so far.

The biggest issue I have is being able to hear through the earpiece. Unless you ear is EXACTLY on a random ""sweet spot' good luck hearing in anyhintg but the quietest environments. I even removed the little ""M"" circle with little or no help. The second shortcoming is the the screen. While it has more colors available than the v551 the resolution does NOT look nearly as good.

Once we got the phones I called back to check and yes the person from Cingular had done everything as asked, I also checked from the phone itself as you can go to ""My Account"" from the Main Menu page and phone goes online and checks everything about your account, how many minutes, the plan, when the next bill is due, etc etc, and sure enough everything was as it was supposed to be.As far as signal strength it is excellent in my area, I can go all through our house upstairs and downstairs and it stays between 4-5 bars, I don't recall seeing less than 3 bars all around town so far, the phone gets a great signal, and Cingular ""in my area"" puts out a great signal.My wife just came back from a business trip, she was about 150 miles away ""With NO ROAMING charges"" btw our last cell phone service ""Alltel"" would have been roaming within 20 miles.Anyway when she got to the hotel she called we both had perfect signal strength, we both put phone in ""Speaker Phone"" mode and she just laid the phone in closed position on the night stand while she unpacked her suitcases, I put mine on my night stand and we talked for about an hour with no problems at all, and it was a FREE call ""Mobile to Mobile"".We sent a couple text messages to each other that worked no problem.She used the phone as her Alarm clock the next morning which worked perfectly.Now as for what 1-2 reviewers have said about the battery life, most likely they have gotten one of those 1-2 out of 1000.I've had phone 12 days have charged it 3 times and have never let it go to the point where is says it ""needs"" charging, so average 4 days per charge and just like the manual states it appears as though battery life is getting a bit better after a few charges, So I'm easily going to get 3-5 days per charge, and that's with a lot of fiddling around with it because it's new and 1-2 hours talk time.Some one mentioned they dropped the phone on its hinge and it broke. I have yet to drop the phone but it seems to be very well made to me, either way I would suggest getting a Krusell cover for it which I did but has not been delivered yet, and also insurance for $4.99 a month from Cingular which covers anything and everything for life of the phone, thus that problem is solved.Someone mentioned something about the ""address book being slow"" not even sure what that means, I only have about 8 numbers in it so far but it comes up virtually instantly for me, maybe if you have 100++ numbers in it might take a couple seconds? dunno.As for searching through the phone book, they mentioned you have to make a new entry for each number for same person, NO you don't, you have the option to show numbers any way you wish, either by ""Name"" or ""Speed dial #"" or ""Voice name"" or even by ""Email"" and with or without a picture of the person.Someone said it took them 5-10 seconds to open address book and dial a number from it, well I just now did it in under 3-4 secs, not to mention if you have it set for ""Voice command"" it takes 1 sec.Want it faster and easier if you have a lot of names/entries? then set it for ""list only"" ""no picture"" and by ""primary number only"", simple. You can also separate numbers even further by putting in ""Categories"" such as ""Business/Personal/General/VIPs""Bring up Category your number is in only that way even if you have 100s of Names & #s it thins them to category.When you have ""primary number only"" listed all you need to do then to get all the other numbers & Email listing for that Name is to ""Highlight name and use left or right on the Navigation button to get all the other numbers"" once again very simple and easy to use. I find the Phone book to be excellent & fast.1-2 have mentioned something about ""ear piece volume too low""  the ear piece volume is fine just make sure the ""volume"" is turned up and it is just a good as any other cell phone I have ever used, make sure your ear is right at the ""top edge of the phone"", too low and volume will sound low. Someone mentioned to take out the little blue cover, do NOT do that since it has nothing to do with ear piece volume, there are 4 speaker holes along the top edge of phone just make sure center of your ear is even with these holes and volume is just as loud as any phone you have used.Now myself I find the phone overall to be excellent, gets a great signal, has way more than enough features for me, works very well for its intended purpose ""PHONE"" seems to be very well made, nice size, looks great, has a really nice screen with sharp image & colors.I have only ONE complaint so far......The screen which looks outstanding inside under any indoor lighting, especially if you are in the dark, well that same screen outdoors under ""sunlight"" is virtually unreadable. So there you have my one gripe.I will come back and update this if anything changes, but as for right now and for FREE and can hardly see how you can go wrong with this phone.UPDATE: 4/08/08My wife and I still have both of these phones, neither of us have had even one single problem with them and its getting close to 3 years of everyday use (these are our only phones, we only have cell phone service no land line).The only slight problem we have had in over 2 1/2 years is when we finally had to change the battery we went with the cheap $5 battery that you can find several places and they were no where even close to as good as the original battery but that is not the fault of the phone.These phones have preformed flawlessly and we use the hell out of them.",5,"Look carefully at the ""bad reviews""",1128643200,"10 7, 2005"
ANF5BP1SD3Z3O,B0006I2E1O,"Seven of Nine, Tertiary Adjunct of Unimatrix 01","[8, 9]",I live in an area where Cingular service is really good; I have experienced virtually no dropped calls.  The phone itself is not one that I picked or researched extensively.  My son tossed my old phone into the wash and thanks to the insurance I had previously purchased I got this phone as a replacement.  It is longer and wider than my old Motorola phone but it is also thinner.  I was concerned about the thickness and durability.  This phone is also metal so I feel more confident using it than I did my previous Motorola phone.My old accessories don't fit even though it is the same manufacturer this just seems silly but what can you do?I purchased Motorola Phonetools 3.0 by Avanquest for my previous phone.  I plugged my new phone in and the program automatically updated to 4.0 and it prompted me to add a profile for my current phone.  With this program I can make my own ring tones and manage my address book and sync it with Outlook so I don't have to worry about saving my settings to my sim chip.  I also put my favorite picture of my phone dunker and his brother in my phone's memory and I use it as my wallpaper.My Bluetooth accessories work better with this phone than my previous Motorola.  On that phone the connection between the earpiece and the phone would suddenly stop functioning.  I could not hear anyone through the earpiece or using the phone and to make it function I had to power the phone off and on each time I used my Bluetooth headset - annoying.The Razr and my Jabra work well together.  It works great for voice dialing in my experience and I can answer the cell and drive - though I rarely do this because I am one of those people who actually like to be unreachable sometimes.So I am very happy with this phone but in fairness to other reviewers I did not have specific expectations when I acquired this phone.,4,Razr V3 works great for me.,1162166400,"10 30, 2006"

In that time (during which the phone was never dropped, bumped, etc), I've replaced my phone twice, and hers once. The problems we've had include:- random ""white screen of death""- Bluetooth connectivity problems (isolated to phones)- dropped calls in perfect reception areas- random battery indications- the infamous ""Unable to Charge"" problemAdd to that Motorola's lousy phonebook and UI, and retarded Bluetooth handling (e.g., if any BT device is connected, the same Moto default ring sounds, regardless of sound profile or caller-specific ringtones), and you have an overpriced, overhyped, oversize paperweight.I'm fortunate Cingular offers my company's employees discounts on new phones, so that I can go back to Sony Ericsson. My old T616 gave me 2 years of perfect service, even after having been dropped twice. It's on its 2nd owner now, who has used it for 6 months problem-free.",1,"Goodbye, Moto",1126569600,"09 13, 2005"
A35IX2GE0VC0JP,B0006I2G3U,"FirePepper Red ""firepepper red""","[6, 6]","I bought this phone because it was a Editors choice in a leading computer magazine.  I would have preferred the Motorola V3 Razor but that is still far too expensive and I have found that this phone is basically the same as the Razor just not as thin or stylish.Plus points of this phone include:- A beautiful screen. It is large, bright, and has excellent resolution.- very good pictures from the camera.  I can't believe that it is just .3 megapixels... of course you won't be able to blow them up into posters or anything like that but for viewing on a computer or even the occasional 3x5 print the pictures are very good.- excellent sound quality from the speaker so your ringtones and the speakerphone sound great.- very nice construction with a easy to grip rubberized metal trim and back.- the button layout is very nice with a dedicated button for taking pictures and volume buttons on the side.  Also of note is that most of the buttons are user programable.- the phone also has voice dialing and picture caller id (although the pictures are very small and do not appear on the external display)- the bluetooth is very easy to set up and use- it is a true Quad band phone that can be used worldwide (although it has to be unlocked first).- excellent battery life.  I can't believe some of the reviews that say it needs to be charged every day... I find myself charging the phone after about 4-5 days with moderate use.  Of course I have the screen saver turned off and I make sure that the bluetooth is disabled when I am not using it so maybe that is why I have great stanby and talk times.  Also the place where I purchased my phone told me to charge it for 24 hours before the first use (to condition the Li battery) so maybe this has helped to increase the battery life.The Negative points about this phone include:- the blue external display looks cool but I think it would be more visible if it were typical backlit black on white LCD (like on the motorola v180)- the instruction manual (like most Motorola manuals) does not do a good job of explaining all the features so you will have to play with the phone a little bit to fully make use of all that this phone can do.- Even though the pictures from the camera are excellent, the video quality is not so good.  Of course this is a cell phone not a video camera so I guess it is about what you would expect.  Also there is no flash on the camera (unlike some other camera phones) so low light pictures are not that great.- there is no USB port on the phone so unless you want to buy a motorola cable, the only way to transfer pictures to your computer (and mp3's to your phone) is via bluetooth. (HINT: you can get a bluetooth adapter for less than $20 bucks so don't waste your money buying the motorola cable. Also with the bluetooth adapter you won't need any special software to transfer pictures or mp3... just use the software with the bluetooth adapter).- the connector for the charger has the typical motorola design so occasionally you have to jiggle it to get it to fit in just right but make sure that your PRESS the button on the connector before removing it or else you will damage the contacts... this may be why some users are having problems charging their phones- the phone only comes in blue so it does not look as cool as other motorola phones like the v180 or the razorAll in all this is the best phone that I have owned.  User's who complain about call drops and bad signals should be complaining about the carrier and not the phone.  Personally I have noticed that ever since the Cingular and AT&T; merger, signal quality and call quality have both declined.  A Cingular rep told me it is temporary until they are able to better integrate both networks... this makes sense because I have only had this problem since I switched my SIM card to the new Cingular SIM that makes use of both networks.",5,Excellent Phone,1125878400,"09 5, 2005"
A2ZZGWC4FUGJAE,B0006I2G3U,M. Jarvis,"[17, 18]","I've had this phone for about four months now, and I haven't had a single technical problem with mine, even after a couple of typical drops on paved surfaces.  I do charge it every night; however, I've found that the Bluetooth radio makes a very significant difference in battery life, which may spur some of the complaints about the shorter battery life than the V400 (no BT capability on that one).  It is possible to turn off the BT radio if you don't need it for any accessories or connections.  My charge lasts for several days if I do this.  I really don't feel inconvenienced by charging daily and leaving BT on, though.In general, the phone has great screen quality (compared directly to my friends' V400s), great speakerphone and polyphonic ringtone capability, great sound quality at both ends, great voice dialing performance (very useful with headset), and I'm entirely satisfied with the camera, considering it IS a cellphone camera.I'll admit the interface was a bit cumbersome at first, but it's VERY customizable with changeable function keys, shortcuts, and menu orders.  I find mine very efficient since I've tweaked it to suit my tastes and usage.Additionally, contrary to some previous reviews, I have successfully transferred both information (phone book, etc.) and media (pictures, ringtones, etc.) to and from the phone with my Bluetooth adapter on my PC, without using Cingular's services.  I did have some trouble getting it to work initially, but I found that it was my firewall getting in the way (remember, Bluetooth IS a network connection).I suppose my one complaint is the conspicuous absence of games (only comes with a Bejeweled demo), but in the end it doesn't really bother me.  I could buy a game for $4 if I really wanted one.Overall, I find the phone very feature-rich and high quality, efficient to use once customized, and as rugged as the average cellphone.",5,I've had a good experience with this phone,1114473600,"04 26, 2005"
A3DVPHGB4K1FIE,B0006I2G3U,P. Oh,"[7, 8]","My chief complaint with this phone is that the Ringtone selector is accessible from the outside of the phone which causes it to be changed when simply handling it or fiddling with it in your pocket. There have been numerous times where i have missed calls because it was inadverdantly set to silent just from being pulled out of my pocket! The rest of the complaints are from the poor and confusing Motorola software and menu structure. This phone does quite a bit but rarely can i find how to access these features even after months of ownership and i have owned several other Motorola phones before. I often am talking and am buried in some inscrutable set of menu's when i am trying to do something else like activate bluetooth or find a number in the phonebook The software is also slow and unresponsive compared to Nokia or Samsung which gives it a lazy and inexact feel. Some of the pluses are the rubberized finish which is easy to grip, full support for bluetooth (although bluetooth sucks up so much battery power that it becomes borderline useless) and nice large well lit keys and crisp screen.The phone has an overall feeling of solidity without being too heavy or clumsy feeling. I have gotten more drops on this phone than any other but i have never used cingular before so i don't know whether its the service or phone. Overall i want to like the phone but i'm searching for something else as the frustrations arent worth it.",2,Frustrating flaws make for painful ownership,1119225600,"06 20, 2005"
A3LSLLR3OAJI7Y,B0006I2G3U,Steven Metz,"[32, 34]","Bottom LineStrongly recommended.  This phone replaced a highly-rated NEC 525 so my assessment is largely in comparison to it.  Based on my research, the V551 has virtually the same features as the much more expensive Razr V3(although not as thin and made largely of plastic rather than brushed aluminum).  From the many online reviews I've read, early versions of the V551 had problems with lockups and dropped calls.  I haven't seen many of those types of comments lately so I'm assuming Motorola worked the kinks out.Pros--Very good reception and sound quality.  Gets three and four bars in my office; I had to stand by the window to use the NEC--It's nice looking; the body is mostly plastic but appears solidly made (the NEC was plug ugly).  Nice raised number keys.--Calls and rings can be made very loud (which is good since I often carry it in a pocket or briefcase, or have it in the car with the sunroof open and music blaring)--Decent quality pictures for a phone camera--Bluetooth--MP3 ringtones; also extensive selection of built in ringtones (although most aimed at young users rather than professionals).--Good speaker phone function--EDGE makes for fast web browsing--Excellent procedure for downloading and saving data via WAP--much easier than the NEC--I can now access Hotmail which I couldn't with the NEC--Nice looking screen--ITAP text entry system works better than the similar function on the NEC--Good voice dialing (the voice tags on my NEC simply took me to that phone book entry and didn't actually dial which the Moto does)--Ability to change ring volume and method (to include a useful vibrate then ring method) with external keys is very handy; ring volume can be made very loud--Buttons and functions are highly customizable--Very good date book--Quad band (I've used my NEC and the Siemens it replaced in about a dozen countries, including Iraq)--Nice price ($74 from AT&T;)Cons--Organization of the phone book is a common complaint but once I figured it out, it's fine.  You can store five numbers and an email per entry. (You must save entries to the phone not the SIM, and organize by primary listing).  It's not the best--the NEC allowed multiple emails plus other information--but it works.--Battery life is also a complaint but I found that by following Moto's recommendations--completely discharge and re-charge it the first few times--it's fine.  Now I can go 3 to 5 days between charges with normal use.  (As another reviewer noted, the battery life was short for the first few days I had it but then improved dramatically.)--Physically the V551 is a bit thick compared not only to my NEC but also to my previous Motos--a Star Tac and V60.  But it does fit in a suit jacket pocket--Speaker phone function can only be turned on during a call, not before--Maximum time before the screen turns off for power saving is 20 seconds.  You have to touch a key to make it come back on.  This can interfere with things like downloads--Screen icons are small and fuzzy; the user's manual doesn't explain what they are--Small navigation keys, but that's the price you pay for a relatively small phone--Of the three built-in skins, two are glaringly bright and tacky.  As with the ringtones, Moto was clearly focused on young users rather than professionals--When using a Bluetooth headset, the V551 will only use a cheesy, stock ringtone--personal ones will not work--You have to go through the recognition routine with a Bluetooth device every time you use it (although this only takes about ten seconds).--Works great with a Moto Bluetooth headset but I've had less luck linking with a non-Moto Bluetooth adapter for my computer--Lousy user's manual--Lousy user's manual--Did I mention the lousy user's manual? (this is inexcusable)--Voice dialing is not universal.  In other words, it ""learns"" one voice rather than responding to anyone saying the correct word or phrase.--Stubby antenna (although this is a trade-off: I get better reception than with the internal antenna on my NEC)--I would have been happy to pay the extra fifty cents or so it would have cost to have real metal on the front instead of plastic made to look like metal.--The synchronization software (Motorola Mobile Phone Tools)and cable cost extra.  I have not been able to make it function.  Motorola's support is utterly worthless--I asked for help online and they told me to call them.  Two attempts led to disconnects after 10-15 minutes on hold without ever getting to an actual tech person.  The software developer--BVRP--is trying to help but hasn't been able to fix the problem.  I may seek a refund from the online vendor and look into alternative sync software.",4,I'm Very Pleased,1117152000,"05 27, 2005"

Overall it is not a bad headset but it does have some flaws.*** Plus points include:***- uses a single AAA battery so there is no need to lug around a charger when traveling.  This alone is reason enough to make many people consider this headset over others.- Great battery life.  I don't understand the user that complained of only getting 1 hour of standby time.  Normally I get about 5-7 days standby with 4-5 hours talk time on a AAA rechargeable that is already somewhat depleted.  A fully charged AAA or a AAA alkaline should do far better!- fits snugly on the ear and is relatively low profile...although some users are right in that occasionally it feels like it might fall off the ear even though it is snug.- Great price from Motorola dot com.  I got this for $23 bucks with a leather pocket clip (including shipping).- No internal battery so you won't have to throw it away when the battery dies (the plantronics has a non replaceable internal rechargeable so when the battery dies in 1-2 years you will have to buy another headset).*** Negative Points Include: ***- The side multifunction button is too easy to press accidentally so occasionally I end up redialing the last call.- The plastic is a little too lightweight so if you drop it, it will get scratched.- Switching ears is not as straightforward as it was with the Plantronics headset.  You have to remove the earpiece clip and then reprogram the volume buttons.  It doesn't take long but it is still a hassle compared to the Plantronics which only requires you to rotate the rubber ear insert.- The volume is definately not as high as the plantronics headset but it should be adequate for most people in most situations.- The light does not give you any clue as to the status of its battery.  The Plantronics will start flashing a red light when the battery gets weak whereas the motorola just starts beeping.  Great if you have it on your ear but not so good if you have it sitting on your desk or in the leather pocket clip.- The motorola does seem to have a lower range than the plantronics. I am not sure if that has to do with the battery not  being fully charged but I was able to use the Plantronics downstairs while my phone was upstairs whereas the Motorola will lose the connection as soon as I get to the base of the stairs.Overall the Motoroal HS805 is a great headset for first time bluetooth users or for anyone who travels a lot or talks a lot and does not want to lug around a power adapter, but if you want a lot of the latest features then you should look elsewhere.",3,Good  headset but has its flaws,1144540800,"04 9, 2006"
AIAKZ754VJ6F,B0007IOMOU,Mark R. Lindsey,"[6, 6]","The battery life on this unit is great. I can use it daily for an hour or so every day, on a single AAA for at least two weeks. (It appears from other reviews that this can vary a lot.)I use this headset with both a Treo 650 phone, and a Apple PowerBook G4. On the Apple, I can use it as a generic output device. (I'm sure the same goes for other headsets.) The signal is strong enough on the Apple to use it from about 30 feet away; on the Treo 650, the signal is not nearly as good.The sound is OK. It's not the best. If it's noisy -- e.g., like driving, or in a hotel room with the air conditioner fan blowing full-blast  -- OR if the person on the other end is not talking very loudly, then it's sometimes hard to hear.It'll drop audio -- i.e., the call goes back to my cell phone -- when the battery is getting low. You can milk it a while longer, but that's really your first clue about the battery.The earpiece is OK; it's not as secure as I'd hope. If you're outside in a gust, you may want to hang on to it.Also, people on the other end sometimes can tell I'm on a headset with this one -- they mention that I sound a little staticky.This is my first bluetooth headset, so perhaps my rating is higher just because it's a nifty gadget. But the battery life on this is really the winner -- my work-mates have rechargeable headsets, and it seems like they're always having to charge them.

I got so frustrated, I was about to throw this thing out of the window.  For a product that use regular batteries, the battery door is the most difficult to open.  Once opened, you need a pair of tweazers to pull the battery out.  The battery compartment is very deep and extremely snug.  This must be a sick joke by Motorola.  Forget about changing the battery on the go, you need to sit down and have a few tools and a lot of patience.  (for the record: this was my breaking point, i had to return this unit, because installing the battery for the first time was enough of a turn-off)- sound quality is mediocre at best",1,Bad Design...,1126915200,"09 17, 2005"

A1XDM756QE06E4,B0007MAOOS,"Gregg L. DesElms ""Gregg L. DesElms""","[2, 2]","First, I'm a huge fan of TPU cases; and hate silicone ones.  There's a huge difference, in case you, the reader, doesn't know.  TPU is better... LIGHT YEARS better!But there are a lot of not-so-good TPU cases out there; and not because there's anything wrong with the TPU. Rather, it's because they're cheaply made, or not cut precisely accurately... that sort of thing.This particular case is the very epitome of precision cut.  It's perfect.  Every hole is centered on whatever it reveals beneath... the camera lens, the flash, the speaker, the mic holes, the earphone jack, and, of course, the stylus.  Note that there's no holes for the power button or volume rocker......and that, TRUST ME, is the way it SHOULD be!  So many of these TPU cases make cutouts for the power button and volume rockers, and that's a huge mistake.  If you've ever cleaned an old-style computer mouse -- you know, the ones with the hard rubber ball partially hanging down out of the centerhold on the bottom -- if you've ever open one of those up and cleaned one, then you've seen the dark kinda' fuzzy weird stuff that you must scratch off all the rollers and whatnot.  That stuff is body oil, mixed with skin cells, mixed with dust and hair, mixed with lint from the mouse pad, mixed with godknows what else.  It gets into and under and around virtually anything which humans touch......including down inside and around the hardware buttons on a smartphone!  And when that stuff gets in there, buttons stick, and phones either won't turn on or off, or can't have their screens awakened properly... or, one of the common ones which people often don't realize is caused by a sticking power button:  boot loops!Having a TPU cover which covers the power button and volume rocker helps eliminate that problem.  Of course, there's still the electromechanical HOME key that's uncovered; and if you look on YouTube you can find examples of phones which their owners mistakenly believe are broken, because their HOME keys cause weird behavior; but, in fact, all that's wrong is that over time the HOME key has gotten all gunked-up with the aforementioned body oil, mixed with dust and hair, mixed with... well... you get the picture.There's not a lot we can do about the HOME key problem (if it's a hardware electromechanical one, as opposed to a simple capacitive on on the glass), but we sure can keep the crap out of our power buttons and volume rockers with TPU cases that cover them......and this one does... and magnificently.  It even has nicely-molded buttons (as opposed to cheap TPU cases which just have a sort of bulge with a little bit of texture added to it.  This case is simply molded beautifully!This case is special for another reason, too, which many people, I'll bet, don't know about, and that's precisely how its sides wrap up and onto the front face of the phone: the bezel around the glass screen.  It's really nice, and very different from how other TPU cases do it.Remember that the Note II is kinda' unique in that the very, very edges of its glass screen  aren't like almost any other phone.  Most phones have a perfectly flat piece of glass as their screens; and then there's the metal bezel of the case which almost comes into contact with the glass's edge all-'round; and the top of the bezel is ever-so-slightly elevated above the flat plane of the glass screen, so that if you place the phone on its glass screen on a table, the glass, itself, it not actually touching the table because that bezel edge is holding it a millimeter or so up off the table's surface.Well, the Note II's glass is actually higher up (when it's lying on its back) than the bezel edge of the case; and, in fact, the very, very edge of the Note II's glass seesm to roll over and down toward the case's bezel. As such, if you lay the Note II on its face (on its glass, it's the glass that actually touches the table.  This makes for a bit of nightmarishness with regard to screen protectors; and one maker of them (REALOOK) manufactures two dry-apply versions for the Note II: one that sits on just the flat part of the Note II's screen, and so leaves a wider-than-normal amount of uncovered glass between the edge of the screen protector and the actual glass edge; and then they make another (the REALOOK ""3D"" screen protector for the Note II) that's molded to actually wrap over the rounded edge of the Note II's glass, and ""hang"" down over it, so to speak, to make the protector's edge come closer to the case's bezel, and causing it to COMPLETELY cover the glass and its rounded edge.With most TPU cases, the TPU sides wrap up and over onto the face of the glass; and with totally flat screen protectors which leave a half millimeter or so between the screen protector edge and the bezel, that's fine.  The TPU case actually ends-up covering that edge and make it look like the screen protector is covering the entire glass.  But with the  REALOOK ""3D"" style screen protector that wraps over the edge, that other kind -- the most common kind -- of TPU case can cause the edges and corners of the 3D screen protector to curl or pull up.This BoxWave Tuxedo SuitUp case is magnificently shaped so that its edge around the glass protrudes up higher than the plane of the glass, so that if the phone is laid on its face (on its glass sreen), the glass doesn't touch because it's being held a millimeter or so up off the table or desk.  But it gets better:  That edge ""respects"" the rounded edge of the Note II's glass, and doesn't try to wrap up over onto and cover it.  Therefore, the REALOOK 3D screen protector's edges and corners remain intact and look beautiful.This is a very special TPU case... different from most others... and the only kind you can have, actually, if you use either a wet- or dry-apply screen protector whose edges go either all the way to, or over the edge of, the Note II's glass.Seriously, this thing is PRECISION... someone REALLY took a moment to figure out how best to cover the unusual Note II... and got it PERFECT!The only thing I wish it had was a matte finish back so that it wouldn't show such fingerprints.  The TPU cases out there that are called ""s-style"" or ""s-series"" TPU cases have matte finish on one side of the ""s"" shape on the case's back, and a shiny finish (like this case has everywhere) on the other side of the ""s"" shape on the case's back.  The entire back of this BoxWave Tuxedo SuitUp should be the kind of matte finish that's on those ""s"" cases, in my opinion; or there should at least be an option to get it either way.Sadly, those ""s"" series or style cases are of the type whose side wrap all the way up and over onto and touching the glass, and on the Note II, that doesn't work well with most screen protectors. Plus, many of those ""s"" style or series cases have uncovered power and volume rocker buttons. Most of them also leave too much phone uncovered around the camera and flash... none of which are problems with this BoxWave Tuxedo SuitUp; and so for me, at least, it's worth it to just endure its shiny, fingerprint-showing surface.Great case!  Best-of-breed, at least among cases that don't cause the edges and corners of screen protectors to curl-up and pull-up.  If one is not using a ""3D"" type of screen protector from REALOOK, though; if one is using REALOOK's other screen protector that attaches to just the flat part of the Note II's screen, then any of the other TPU cases for the Note II would be fine (as long as they cover the power and volume rocker buttons); but the thing is that few of them are made as nicely as this one. Seriously, this one is made very, very well... very precise. I just love it!Gregg L.

So, I try this new MX505.Although I am very impress by the sound quality and unique design, it doesn't fit me too well.  Let me summarize the Pros and Cons first:Pro:Sound qualityDesign fit almost every ear type: the grey area on the ear piece is actually, soft plastic.  It makes it very easy to adjust and fairly comfortable to wear.it comes with a spare voice tubesvolumn adjustable controlCon:the cord is a little short for me, and it is around 8 cm shorter than my old MX110.  I prefer to put the phone on a further distance when I use the phone.  So, it won't bother me when I work.  If the cord is at least 30 cm or 50cm longer, it would be great.The  design doesn't fit me well... or it wouldn't wear for long comfortably.  The main reason is that it is ""soft"" plastic, not cushioned like the MX110.  Yes, it is able to clip onto the ear much better than other design.  I still feel the ""clip plain"" after wearing it for 10 min.  It is not a very painful feeling, just not very comfortable.The volumn control is good, but the build quality is not.  It uses rather cheap or thin plastic shell.  Additionally, the ""Mute"" button is not the ""soft push"" eletonic type.  It is the older switch design type, which you push to the right is ""Mute"" and push to the left is ""Unmute"".  It is rather chessy to me.My main suggestion to plantronic is that, please add the cushion on the ""ear clip"".  Secondly, please either take out the volumn control or improve it or offer longer cord.  I mean, if the cord is not long enough, why do you need a volumn control?",4,"Good Sound Quality and Unique design, but not always fit everyone.",1154995200,"08 8, 2006"

A3VS7IZZVC6337,B0007PLXS6,Ted Pavlic,"[0, 0]","I purchased this dual car charger to replace aPowerGen Dual USB 3.1A 15w High Output Car Charger. The PowerGen charger is a little large for the inconvenient location of the accessory port in my Toyota Scion xD, and so I liked the low profile of this charger. However, from the reviews, I got the impression that this charger would not charge an Android phone at high capacity. So I also purchased aUSB Charging Cablewhose pin configuration is setup to trick an Android phone to charge in 1A ""AC"" mode. Sadly, the cable I received appears to be a standard USB data cable. However, to my surprise, the ""iPhone / iPod"" port (the top port) triggers the ""AC"" charging mode of my Samsung Galaxy Nexus Android phone. So in that case, I don't need any special cable. I can use the top port for my device, and my wife's iPhone charges in the bottom ""iPad / iPad2"" port.This charger extends itself about 0.25 inches (6 mm) out of the accessory port. It's much more compact than the PowerGen (which also has Apple and Android ports), but there are a few dual chargers that are a little shorter. In our car, the PowerGen has a problem that it sometimes doesn't fit well in the port and a connection isn't made without re-seating it. We were surprised by this, because the nearly identicalMediabridge High Output Dual USB Car Charger(which only is high capacity for Apple devices) has no trouble fitting in our car. Sadly, this BoxWave charger also sometimes loses connection and we have to re-seat it.For now, I'm happy with the device. It charges my Android phone in ""AC"" mode and appears to charge my wife's iPhone. It is relatively low profile (our cups in the adjacent cupholders don't seem to bump into it so much), and it feels like a sturdy device.

Seems to be actual leather unlike many similar cases that claim to be leather and are actually plastic. So if you wear skinny jeans and tend to keep the phone shoved in a pocket, this is not for you. But if you carry it elsewhere and are not concerned with combining your phone with some essential bits of your wallet, this is really really nice. If you tend to travel in a car and wind up carrying both the phone and your wallet into places to eat. This allows you to get three basic things out of the wallet and eliminate the need to carry two into the restaurant.It makes holding onto the phone less complicated by a factor of a googol. Particularly in landscape.The material (seems to be leather) is impregnated with a serious amount of oil so when you close the lid, it leaves a mark on the face of the phone. The simple solution to this is to get a paper index card, fold it at the red line on the top and shove the little folded bit in to the slot behind the cards.

Frankly it is the the most comfortable headset I have ever worn, and I've worn dozens.  I truly forget it is on my head.As for sound quality, everything I hear is clear, with ample volume available.  People I speak to report equally clear sound without much, if any background noise.Battery life is great and range is sufficient for me to put my smartphone on the cradle and walk around the house or the office without any signal loss or crackling.Something else I liked was the belt clip.  So many headsets overlook the fact that you have nowhere to put your earpiece when you're not using it.  The belt clip is small, just big enough to actually hold the headset, and tucks in right behind the clip for my phone.If you're not a clip-loving person, the whole headset has an almost flat profile so it fits nicely in a pocket.  Other headsets, especially those with flip-out mics feel awfully bulbous in a pocket.One last little ""Gee Whiz"" feature- the vibro-alert.  Since I want my phone on the charge/sync cradle whenever possible, this feature really excites me.  Instead of being required to actually wear the headset at all times to avoid missing a call when the phone is in the other room, this headset has a vibrate feature to notify me of an incoming call.  I call this a ""gee whiz"" feature because I never knew I needed it until I had it!In summary, there are an awful lot of headsets out there.

The headset, which I purchased online, arrived with no instructions, but did include the charger, charger cord, belt hook, and several earbuds. A quick search online discovered the manual and pairing was accomplished shortly thereafter. All functions of the headset, including vibrating ring and voice dial, work with my phone. Sound quality is generally excellent -- it's at least as good as the phone's earpiece. All bets are off if you're out in the wind or driving with the window down, precisely the same conditions under which you can't hear the phone's own earpiece either. External noise such as a crowded restaurant doesn't seem to be a problem for my combination of phone and headset. The short boom mike seems to be acceptable -- nobody has complained they can't hear me. In fact, I can talk pretty softly under most circumstances and be heard just fine. External noise such as a crowded restaurant doesn't seem to be a problem for my combination of phone and headset. The battery is advertised to last a long time and it does. I haven't measured any run-down times, but the headset needs to be charged less often than the phone, which with bluetooth on needs a charge every couple days. The headset is light and, for me, comfortable; after wearing it 12 hours a day for the first several days I forget it is there. The headset is reversable by the simple expedient of rotating the earbud. The dorsal sping of the headset contains one button and one rocker switch. Because of the location of the switches they do not need reversing. The rocker controls volume up and down; the button combines on/off and answer/hang-up. Press the button to answer or hangup, hold for about 5 seconds to turn off/on. My phone hangs up when the other party disconnects and conveniently, so does the headset. The headset slips into the charging cradle like a knife into a holster. An accessory clip attaches to the charging cradle so you can hang the cradle (unplugged, of course) on your belt or waistband to carry the headset when it's not being worn. With practice, the headset can be put on with one hand. There is no provision for charging in an automobile, which would be inconvenient were battery not so long-lasting. Just pop the headset into the charger in the evening and you're good for the next day. On an extended trip the charging cord and cradle must accompany the traveler.  Other than the lack of a car adapter, which can be remedied aftermarket, my only complaint is that the headset is somewhat wobbly on my ear and the ear bud occasionally works itself away from my ear canal. This is not always immediately apparent until a call is made/received. This is aggravaated by the fact that there is no way to adjust the headset, it being constructed of a plastic shell with a soft lining against the ear. Even the flexible shaft holding the ear bud does not adjust side to side.  The headset is rated for up to 30 meters; this does not include walls or other obstructions. Jabra recommends you wear the headset on the same side that you carry your phone. Practice proves this. Lack of adjustability aside, this is a good headset with outstanding battery life.

A25LM23UM50GD,B0007W1K3C,"Mark ""Sorokahdeen""","[21, 22]","Shure's QuietSpot headset is the best headset on the market, period. The only problem with it is Shure's coyness about how it works and why microphone placement is *absolutely crucial* when using it. Once you understand that, you understand everything you need to in order to want it more than you want anyone else's.The ""problem"" with the QuietSpot--mentioned by other reviewers here--is not a failure of engineering or quality control, but one of emphasis in their documentation. Barring an actual defective unit (which will usually not work at all) there is nothing wrong with the QuietSpot that proper adjustment doesn't totally eliminate. I believe that Shure doesn't tell you this for fear of alienating technically unsophisticated customers. Since I have nothing to sell you, I am blissfully unconcerned with boring you and can write something useful. Please note that I write this on the basis of a close examination of a working QuietSpot and an educated layman's knowledge.Observation tells me that, Shure's QuietSpot headset uses active noise cancellation and it is the only cellular headset on the market that does.  This means that the mouthpiece of the headset uses two microphones: one takes in the sound from the world around you while the second takes in the sound from your mouth.Using  a trick of wiring, this dual-microphone arrangement uses the sound from the outside world and uses it to weaken the sound from the microphone closer to our mouth. Since both microphones take in surrounding sound, the strongest sound that *isn't* cancelled out is your voice.For this to work, the microphones need very good alignment with your mouth. The  QuietSpot demands that you have the 'mouth-side' microphone pointed directly at your mouth, and the 'world side' microphone pointed directly outwards without mis-alignments like having the microphone-housing too far below or two far above the side of your mouth, or having the microphone housing turned on its side.The tough part about this is that the boom that holds the microphone can twist and bend while the QuietSpot is in your pocket or case, turning the microphone head around onto its side. If the microphone-head is turned on it's side, or set too far above or below your mouth, then both microphones pick up your voice with equal intensity and the arrangement does exactly as it's supposed to: It treats *your voice* like background-noise and sends everything you say off into oblivion.The solution is easy and useful: you have to learn to put the QuietSpot's microphone in the right place every time you put it on. Once you learn to do this with the windscreen on, you have what is close to the perfect headset. I have used the QuietSpot, standing in bars in New York City with the jukebox blasting and not had to raise my voice very far above an ordinary conversational volume and with the QuietSpot's noise-blocking earpiece, I could hear my listener perfectly. The two-way noise elimination of a well-adjusted QuietSpot is amazing, providing a sense of intimacy and privacy in conversations that no other headset ever gave me including one or two that cost more.The only other thing you need to know about the QuietSpot is that it is particularly sensitive to wind=noise and unless you intent to never use it outside, it is best to keep the windscreen permanently attached to the unit. You can do this with a needle and thread through the foam, or with a thin-strand of wire. Once you've done this, you'll have to learn to make the important adjustment by touch but even then, it's still easy.Now that you know all this, give the QuietSpot a try. You won't be disappointed.",5,"Brilliant Engineering, slightly unclear documentation",1175212800,"03 30, 2007"

I was quite happy with the audio quality (folks I talked to never complained about background noise, even while driving) and battery life was more than adequate.  Additionally I thought the button functions like mute, swapping calls, etc. were pretty easy to use.Why then, you ask, did you rate it only four out of five stars?  I'm glad you asked!My disappointment came when I merged my cell phone and PDA by buying a smartphone, an HP iPaq.  The headset connected to the new phone without a hitch and worked flawlessly... for a while.After anywhere from a day to a month, without any warning, the headset would cease working, refusing to connect to the phone.  The fix required hard resetting the phone every time it failed.Since hard resetting at random intervals was hardly an acceptable way to go about business, I called Motorola for support.  Without so much as a single step of troubleshooting I was told to contact the phone manufacturer, HP.Would you like to guess what HP told me?  If you guessed ""Call Motorola"", you win the cupie doll.  After calling both manufacturers repeatedly, begging for any input they could give, HP admitted that this headset was not one of a very small group of headsets specifically approved as compatible with the phone.  They added that not being on the list does not necessarily mean it won't work, after all it worked just fine for random periods of time (read: I very well could have a defective headset in my hands).Motorola's response never waivered... ""Go talk to HP.""I knock off a star not for the very plausible prospect that the problem could lie with the phone manufacturer, but for the less than cordial attitude.  Refusing to even troubleshoot a product is called passing the buck.  For all they knew, it very well could have been a defective unit but they were too quick to dismiss me to know for sure.My solution was to buy aJabra BT250v Bluetooth Headset with Vibrating Alert [Retail Packaged], after which I had no problems.My summary would be that this headset will likely perform beautifully with any Motorola phone.

Overall these shortcomings are outweighed by the positives of this device.  It is a very useful and feature rich headset, but be warned that the mild hissing and low volume output will certainly be an annoyance at times.

The speaker's maximum volume is just completely unacceptable. By the way, this experience was inside a luxury car, not a cardboard car.

I found the headset to be much more comfortable than the Jabra BT250v that I used to have.  It is very lightweight, and the earhook fits pretty well.  I stick the headset on the charger for a little while when I get home from work each day so I never have battery issues.  The call quality is adequate on both ends.  I would like the volume a little louder, but it will do.  My wife said that she could hear an ""echo"" of herself.  This is due having the volume all the way up with the speaker and mic being so close together.  However, she couldn't tell a difference between having the A/C on high or low in terms of background noise.  This was also an improvement over the Jabra BT250v.Here's what you need to know about limitations.  Even though both devices support the handsfree profile, you only get the headset profile when you pair the HS-850 and a Treo 650.  This would seem to be Treo's issue.  Bottom line is that you have to press the multi-function button to transfer calls, and you can't use some of the advanced handsfree profile features.

Hence, I have been using wired headset for the past ten years.  The tangling of the headset wire with itself and my mp3 headphones gets rather annoying.  So, I was looking forward to time when the reviews of Bluetooth headsets became positive in the press.When I purchased this model, the information I saw was rather positive, especially about the form factor.  The model is both light and easy to operate.  It intelligently turns on when flipping open the boom.

While it hasn't fallen off, it constantly feels like it might whenever my head is moving.My big complaint with the HS850 is the sound quality. Not only is there a slight hiss, but there is also a slightly noticeable electronic digitization.  I would think by 2006 this problem would be corrected.

I kept it in my pocket so it would be on standby, in contact with my phone.  Most times, it would connect quickly and function well.  Ocassionally, it would seem to connect, but when I attempted an outgoing call, it would disconnect.I also had trouble hearing the unit while driving.  As I am approaching my mid 50's, my hearing is not as acute as in past years, and the internal noise from the pickup truck (windows up, and AC running) makes hearing the other party on the earpiece difficult.My main problem with this unit is the recharge plug.  I have 3 Nextel/Motorola phones that use this type of plug and have not had any trouble with it.  The plug end has a release button to depress when unplugging.  The catch on my HS850 charger plug was more difficult to release and required much more pressure to release than my other 2 Motorola charger plugs of the same type.  This contributed to undue stress on the socket and eventually the socket pulled loose.  I probably charged it 6-7 times over the month I had it.I intend to replace my HS850 with some other type that has an earpiece that fits in my ear, providing some sound isolation from environmental noises, rather than the lay on this ear type.Be careful unplugging this unit from its charging plug.",3,Charging plug catch pulled out charging socket,1155168000,"08 10, 2006"

It feels well made and has a beautiful quality generously proportioned screen; a definite plus for folks who like games on their cells. Although the Amazon listing calls it a Tri-band phone, it is in fact Quad-band. Most importantly for me, it speaks Mac. Using a data cable ( pick up a cheapie on ebay ) it functions flawlessly with iSync for iCal and Address Book. The only thing that I'm not very pleased about is that contact email and addresses don't seem to transfer to the phone ( the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 ). There might be a way to accomplish this, but I haven't been able to figure out how to do it.But what I really like about his phone is that it functions quite handsomely as a wireless bluetooth modem. My phone uses the T-Mobile network, and combined with the ""  all the data you can eat "" program ( around $20 a month ) and my iBook with a D-Link BT adapter, and I'm good to go. The set up is a bit complex, but the nice folks at T-Mobile supplied me with the  info.It's controls are very easy to use and it looks great, I live in a signal challenged area, but I have found that the V330 works better then any other cell I have ever owned. The photo quality isn't anything to write home about, though the zoom feature is pretty effective.

Brown ""EB""","[16, 18]","This is actually a quad-band mobile phone which makes it a true 'world phone'... more so than the common tri-band devices.World phones are generally equipped w/ both 1900 and 1800 frequencies. Together, these frequencies cover Europe, much of the U.S. and many other countries. Most tri-band units, however, are usually equipped with either 850 or 900mhz.850 fills in the 'rural gaps' in The States. 900 allows for roaming in New Zealand and Australia. Whereas both T-Mobile and Cingular operate on GSM frequencies and therefore can offer world phones, Cingular operates on the 850 and T-Mobile on 900. They allow each other to use their frequencies for instances where they don't provide a needed frequency... provided you device is equipped w/ both 850 & 900 mhz as is the Motorola V330.How is T-Mobile? Truth of the matter (as with any mobile phone service) it comes down to the region you live in as well as what building your in and the area that building is in. Sorry, there is no across-the-board answer. As soon as one gets great reception, his/her neighbor curses it.Visually, this phone is indistinguishable from just another flip phone, but it offers rather large and well-spaced keys.

I just got one for my mum.Of course, being a quad-band, video, camera, multi-zoom, bluetooth, infrared device w/ browser, the general ease of operation can only be so easy. That 'said,' many a senior probably couldn't be bothered w/ messing with it all or putting to test call quality in rural U.S. and New Zealand.That you get all of this and at such a price makes the V330 an eyebrow-raising steal.One more thing - That it's blue, not the de riguer black or silver, I like.A quality phone packed w/ a host of goodies.

A1US87X5YUEQ7A,B0008F6QE6,Wayne Schulz,"[7, 11]","I've been using this phone for about three weeks on the T-Mobile system within CT and while travelling. It has been an easy to operate phone. There are a few minor flaws that I've found which you may want to consider prior to making a purchase decision.PROS-Solid reception - seems to hold calls pretty well - have not experienced unexpected call drops.-As near as I can tell people are hearing my calls clearly-Easy to text message with predictive entry - very clear interface and helpful completion of words-While on T-Mobile you can be browsing the web and also receive an incoming voice call (though you cannot continue to browse - the key is that it doesn't send people to your Voicemail). I believe this is a function of the GSM technology that T-Mobile and Cingular operate under.CONS-Earpiece volume is low - you'll have difficulty using this in noisy environments.-Not EDGE (high speed Internet) capable-If there is a way to have multiple contact info (home, business, cell, email) for one address book entry - I haven't found it. Instead I have awkwardly had to setup multiple address entries (how 1980's).-The phone offers a Bluetooth connection - and there should be a standard keypress to turn the BT on and off. Instead you have to create a shortcut or re-map one of the ""smart"" keys to do the task.-It should be easier to change ring styles - most phones allow you to change the style to vibrate right from the volume buttons or a key press - the V330 supports this (kinda) but you have to use the up/down volume and then a smart key to select. The extra steps are tedious when you are trying to go into a store or movie theater and want to mute the phone.SUMMARYI'd purchase this phone again for T-Mobile. I considered other phones before making this purchase and the overall features (including the ability to use Bluetooth)are what attracted me to the V330.The requirement to list multiple names in the phone book is really odd and it might be that I just haven't found the ""secret"". The phone doesn't come with any type of detailed user manual so you have to go online and look at a PDF to get the information. So far I have not uncovered any secret. If I had a large phone book that I wanted to use, then I'd probably have passed on this phone (and any other Motorola using a similar scheme).If you are frequently in noisy environments, this probably is not the phone for you either. The earpiece is just too low. I'm constantly trying to raise the volume when talking to someone out in a crowded place that has noise.For a good middle-of-the road phone with solid reception, I don't think you can go too wrong with the V330.",4,Solid Performer,1129507200,"10 17, 2005"

A1ULPGDCSX8XUH,B000982UY2,Jeantet Fields,"[182, 185]","I have owned a Treo 650 on and off and on again since this model came out.  Initially, I was extremely frustrated by the phone's telephone performance and its lack of stability.  Frequent reboots, freezes and dropped calls made it difficult to appreciate the phone.  I ended up getting rid of it and relying on a separate palm and cell phone.  Over time, PalmOne has released firmware updates (the phone's operating system) that have made the phone very stable.  The improvements we so significant that they actually won me back.  This review is for the GSM Treo 650.A word about Carriers: I only use GSM because I travel abroad frequently - this limits me to Cingular and Tmobile.  I have used both, and I have found that Cingular's network coverage is more complete, especially in rural areas, but Tmobile's network sounds better.  It's a tradeoff - with Tmobile, you'll drop the call more often, but with Cingular you'll say ""what?"" more often.  Their coverage is about equal in big cities and along major highways.  International roaming is less expensive with Tmobile, plus Cingular has a few hurdles in place that prevent you from enabling international roaming on your account if you've been with them for less than 6 months.  Verizon and Sprint use a cellular technology that is US-only, and therefore no good for using your phone abroad.Here are the phone's pros: in your pocket, you have your address book, datebook, notes, e-mail, low-res still and video camera, a very nice sms interface that threads sms exchanges by contact, a web browser, and an mp3 player.  The QWERTY keyboard makes typing much faster than a standard phone.  The interface is unique and you will need a little time to get used to it, but once you do you will be as efficient at quick-dialing and keeping up with daily use as on any other phone.  Also, this phone is a quad-band GSM which means that it will work very well abroad, unlike the more common tri-band GSM phones, which don't perform as well.  (Remember, if you get a Treo Smartphone from Verizon or Sprint, it will not work abroad.)  The screen on the Palm version is brilliant.  The Windows version is not as sharp - a limitation imposed by the operating system.  Also, GSM technology uses ""SIM"" cards, which means you can simply change out the ""SIM"" and use your phone on another network or another phone number, either domestically or while abroad.  (You might have a phone locked onto a carrier's network until your contract commitment is complete, but that's something you can sort out on your own).Here are the phone's cons: I said ""in your pocket"" because if you mount this thing on your belt, the bulge may force you to make alterations on your sport jacket.  Also, in an age of identity theft and information security, you should think long and hard about just how much information is in there.  Believe me, the phone quickly becomes a place to store passwords, account information, customer information, etc.  Consider how you will feel if you leave it in a restaurant, or if it's stolen.Here are lesser cons that can be worked around: The beauty of these palm phones is that they're so popular; other people have had whatever problem you might encounter, and they've written software to address / fix / work around the issue.  For example, I found that the phone's volume is not loud enough.  There is 3rd party volume software to fix that, as well as software that allows you to use the phone as a Bluetooth modem for your computer.  Some software is freeware, some is shareware, and some is for purchase.  The key is that there are so many forums and resources on the Internet that you can search around and find the answers that you need, and the phone allows you to install and uninstall with as much ease as with your home PC.Thoughts about newer Treo phones:  The 650 now costs a little less because the Treo 700w and 700p have come out.  This is a good thing, because I don't see the 700 having any new features that make the upgrade a ""must"".  Other than a slightly redesigned appearance and interface, and higher resolution camera, the phone's features are basically identical.  Also, as of the Summer 2006, the Treo 700 is only available on CDMA networks.  The Treo folks have staggered the release of GSM and CDMA models to give the all carriers a turn at exclusivity.Looking to the future, there is speculation that the next generation Treo phone will be a GSM, it will be thinner, lighter, and the antenna will be internal - basically, it will more resemble a blackberry on the outside.  These are much sought after features by Treo users.  Maybe I'll upgrade then.In conclusion, only 4 stars for this phone because the product wasn't ready for market when they released it.  It's much better now; if they had initially released the current product, I would have given it 5 stars.  I hope my perspective helps you with your decision.UPDATE - Jan 08, 2007: the Treo750 (windows mobile) has come out in the UK with Vodafone, and here in the USA, the Treo680 (Palm OS) has been announced with Cingular.  In forums on the internet, people have reported that the new 680 addresses many wish-list items for the Treo faithful: slighly thinner (a modest few millimeters), internal antenna, better keyboard, volume-too-low issue ""sort of"" resolved, better mp3 player (pTunes instead of Real), more memory, improved phone interface, EDGE instead of GPRS to double the data speed.  Unfortunately, the camera has the same resolution (640x480) and the few millimeters thinner have meant a thinner battery.  Treo 680 owners complain of poor battery life (1 day or significantly less for power users).As of Thanksgiving, every vendor pre-selling the Treo 680 was sold out (including Amazon).  This tells me two things: many Treo users are looking to upgrade immediately by choice, not out of necessity.  As a result, the market should be flooded with inexpensive used Treo650s, and no doubt merchants with 650 inventory will probably sell them inexpensively enough for people who have been priced out of the smartphone market to get their hands on one.Palm says the 680 is targeted to the every day person, not the power user.  I suppose that means in a year we should expect another more expensive model that will be what the 680 should have been.  I feel that Palm is releasing new models in a very slow and calculated manner in order to drive consumer spending.My recommendation: if you want a Treo, go with the 650.  With an extended battery a power user (bluetooth, e-mail, etc.) can go 2 days between charges or 3 days with normal usage.  Look for it online.The smartphone market has become very crowded with the slim Motorola Q (windows), the comparably sized and feature-rich Nokia E61 (legendary stability of Symbian OS), friendlier and proven Blackberry models, the Samsung blackjack (windows), and lately the MDA (windows) is getting rave reviews with all the features you wish you could have, including Wi-Fi.The Treo does a lot - it probably has the best SMS interface on the market, but the rest is just ok.  For example, the mp3 player works, but not as good as a dedicated mp3 player like an iRiver or iPod.  The e-mail application works, but the IMAP implementation is poor, and POP3 performance is inconsistent re: leaving or deleting messages from the server.  If you want a good e-mail application on the Treo, you'll have to buy a 3rd party program that will be almost as good as the blackberry.  But you will have to buy this app, and the more 3rd party apps you load, the less stable the device.  What I'm saying is the Treo is a jack of many trades but it's a master of none (except SMS/MMS messaging.)  While I am a Palm faithful, I'm afraid that if you want a *stable* phone, e-mail, address book and schedule, the blackberry is the way to go, but you won't have the bells and whistles (camera, mp3 player, 3rd party apps and touch screen) that come with a Treo.  Yes, that means I now have a crackberry.  It was a Xmas gift from a friend who was tired of hearing me complain about my Treo.  Here is the bottom line: if you're getting this device as a business tool where missed calls or e-mails translate to lost money, get a blackberry.  If you want a really cool phone with all the bells and whistles you can fathom and you like loading 3rd party applications and you like having a fun device to play with, then you will absolutely love the Treo.",4,"After getting used to it, you can't live without it.",1157673600,"09 8, 2006"
A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ,B000982UY2,"Jeff Edwards ""RadioJeff""","[25, 25]","I have been itching for a Treo ever since the 600 came out and I noticed that more streamlined design.  When smartphones were first introduced, I bucked the trend of combining the two thinking that as often as I use my cell phone and my pda, if I bought one that integrated both I would wear it out twice as fast.  And in my humble opinion, it was a valid reason because back then, the original phone/pda's were impossibly large.  Well I have finally become a convert.I spent a great deal of time researching Blackberry's vs. the Treo's vs. Pocket PC's and came VERY close to grabbing a T-Mobile Dash (which I still believe is the all-around smallest model availabe as I write this, or at least it SEEMED to be), but I finally settled with the trusted Palm OS platform (one that I have become VERY familiar with over the years using pda's for quite some time now).  When I set out to get one, I really had my heart set on the Treo 680...but as I read the reviews for them, one thing kept creeping in to almost all the reviews: battery life was terrible.  With that aside, quite a few of the reviewers mentioned that all things considered, they were more happy with their old 650.  I saw this on so MANY reviews that I began to think twice.  Then I noticed that the 700p was a more beefed up version of the 650, and began to consider it as well.  Unfortunately as I write this, it isn't available with Alltell service where I am (it will, but nobody can give me a target date, and dang it, I am too impatient to wait...) so I am right back with the 650.  It took a while before Palm was able to knock enough of the bugs out of the 650 that I felt like buying one would be worth it...and I am discovering more than a few bugs have been associated with both the 680 & 700p, so no matter HOW much time I spend considering upgrading to a newer model, I find compelling reasons to go right back to the Old School 650.Reason #1 to go with it: Since it is no longer available at Palm's Official website, and with the newer models coming out, chances are you can find some pretty sweet deals on the older 650.Reason #2: Virtually ALL of the problems originally associated with the 650 have been eliminated.  You want Push email?  You can get it.  You want web surfing?  No prob.  You want to view AND edit MS Word Documents and Excell?  Easier than ever with the 650 (that was one major plus over most of the Pocket PC's and ALL of the Blackberrys -- sure you can VIEW some of these documents, but you cannot EDIT them, too).Reason #3: No matter HOW convenient the pda, I found it next to impossible to give up a touch-screen's amazing versatility and the ease with which you can use it to edit things and connect on websites.One more important item to factor in when considering buying a 650: With the popularity with ever increasing wireless downloading speeds, I was afraid that the slower Treo would make internet surfing next to impossible because of the archaic speeds with which you are forced to endure.  I was VERY pleastantly surprised that downloading web pages did not take as long as I was at first expecting.  I have to tell you, after experimenting with the supposedly MUCH faster 700p with another online carrier than the one I was using (I won't say which, but they really did their best to tell me the 650 was slower than a dial-up modem from 1985), anyway, the 650 was only SLIGHTLY slower than this screaming fast 700p or the 700w.  I figured that was something I could live with to be honest.  Hey, it's a tiny hand-held device that allows me to send and receive email and surf the web...I'm still amazed that something like this exists at ALL to be honest with you...so downloading speed is still secondary in my opinion.  If speed really IS on your list of absolutes, maybe you ought to move up to something else...but keep in mind, it is only BARELY faster than what I experienced first hand.One more thing: the screen is amazing.  There are only so many ways to say WOW.  If you are considering buying a Palm that runs Windows Mobile, you ought to know that the screen clarity is almost reduced by HALF.  This apparently has something to do with Window's OS, and seriously put my decision to buy one on the back burner.Sure there are things that a smartphone cannot as yet do without some difficulty or impossibility...but that is the same with ALL current models.  Do some SERIOUS research into what you want vs. what you NEED and make an informed decision only AFTER you have had the chance to go into a store and test a specific model PERSONALLY.  Do that and no matter WHAT you decide on, you will most likely be happy.  So far, I know I am VERY satisfied with my choice.  Good luck on yours.***UPDATE***I opted not to get a Bluetooth hands-free device -- at first.  Originally I would see people walking around with these Lt. Uhura type thingy's sticking out of their ears and I couldn't help but wonder how lazy people are that they cannot raise their hand up to their head while walking around simply to talk on the phone.  For the most part I STILL feel this way, but I decided to buy a Bluetooth hands-free headset for while I am driving.  I cannot afford to miss calls, and being in radio, when not at work or home I can be found in my car monitoring the radio virtually 100% of the time and unfortunately this means I sometimes cannot hear the ringer.  The tethered device that came with the phone is certainly loud enough, but simply did not fit my ear (it kept falling out).  I bought a replacement that came with a variable size adapter and yet while it FIT better, the sound was almost impossible to hear (the worst I have ever experienced, actually).  So I took the plunge knowing full-well that the Palm Treo has a somewhat problematic history using these devices...so I made sure that I had an iron-clad return policy in place and jumped in.  It took me no more than a minute to configure my head-set and I went ahead and made a test call which had more than enough volume -- in fact it had plenty to spare.  All in all I am VERY satisfied with the performance. (I bought a Keycera Bluetooth, if that means anything)One additional item that requires mentioning: I currently have call-waiting as a service with my Treo and yet I have missed at least 3 calls (that I know of).  This particular feature does not seem to be supported by the 650...and IF it is, I have yet to discover any useful info regarding the problem, whether online or in the bible-sized instruction manual.  I will keep looking and IF I find a solution I will quickly report it here asap.  Just one more thing to think about.  Otherwise, I am amazingly satisfied with my Treo otherwise.  The ONLY thing I wish (other than user-friendly call-waiting) is faster downloads while online.  That is supposedly possible with the newer models using EVDO and yet the 700p I tested failed to work only slightly faster than my 650.  Maybe it was the network -- but not according to them (no surprise there).  I still think my purchase was WELL worth it.",5,Everything I had hoped it would be...so far anyway...,1170028800,"01 29, 2007"
A3977M5S0GIG5H,B000982UY2,Joel Dauteuil,"[4, 4]","It's been two weeks with my Treo 650 and now I remember why I love the Palm OS so much. I switched to BlackBerry two years ago (7290) and I've enjoyed using it except for the very, very basic screen. I assume that's how they get such remarkable battery life. But, I've had to switch from the BB for work reasons and I'm very happily using Palm again. My last Palm was a Palm Vx and it's still alive and kicking after many, many years.The Treo 650's screen is really amazing. And, I've read the older reviews about the Treo 650 and the frequent resetting issue. I was certainly concerned and ready to send it back if I had problems (Cingular gives you 30 days to try it out). So far only one reset in two weeks with the Palm - honestly, I had to reset the BlackBerry constantly so I'm not sure I'd notice the difference. And, the BB resets are particularly annoying because they would happen at the start of answering incoming calls and then literally take 5-8 minutes to reset and let me use it again. I'm not sure why it took so long - I did have a big address book. The Palm reset only took 30 seconds.But, here's where Treo shines: screen graphics, photos, mp3s and videos. I can put 2-4 movies on a 2GB SD card, pop into the Palm and carry around some convenient entertainment. One little feature that really impressed me was the ability to display the screen vertically (it's longer that way). With letterbox movies it really increases the size of the video and exceeds the size of videos on my Zen Vision 30GB screen. And, the videos really look incredible.And, of course, there's a ton of free software out there for the Palm. So far, I've only downloaded TCPMP for the movies. The included RealPlayer is very impressive - you're ready to listen to mp3s right out of the box.Final note: I've used the Palm Desktop for PIM stuff (contacts, calendar, to do's) off and on for years and I'm still impressed with it's features and easy/quick navigation. They've always been ahead of the pack - I know many of the newer phones come with similar PIM software so your PC can talk to your new phone but aside from BlackBerry no one else is even in the ballpark.You can manage photos in there as well and even add photos to your address book so once you've synced up your incoming calls display a picture of the caller.

And with memory cards in the gigabytes, I can add any and as much functionality as I care to have--plus store all my rediculous photos and other nonsense without worrying about running out of space.-I'll be using this as my mp3 player, and it's a camera that will be there even when I wouldn't have thought to bring one.-It holds all my appointments, vital information, etc . . . .-It has advantages over the super Japanese cell phones and system in that I can take longer movies and send them by regular e-mail.-When negotiating business over lunch or golf, where it would be a weak hand to bring a stack of papers or notes, you can input and look up information as need be in this device you would be expected to carry instead.-Add that I can basically use as many e-mail accounts on it as I like.This basically negates whatever need I had to carry a laptop unless I'm on an extended business trip.This is truly a computer with internet access in my pocket.  It can do all the same basic stuff a desktop computer can do.I'm only taking one star away because there are now later models even more capable, and if you're considering buying the 650 you might as well get it with faster internet access.Note that friends of mine with the 700w as opposed to the 700p say they miss the Palm native software and some have said they'll switch to the 700p to get it--so it's something to consider if you're thinking of going a step above the 650.Lastly, though I do find this increadibly handy, I don't know that it's worth the asking price that's usually listed.  If a cell phone of any kind is connected to a service, the most it should cost the customer is $200 with a service contract.  There's really no excuse for charging people $500 for any phone (and I wouldn't have bought mine if it didn't cost me exactly $75 used).  They're selling you a service and making you sign a contract that they'll charge you big time for breaking, so they should take the additional expense when it comes to equiptment for for accessing services they're going to charge you or your company through the nose for anyway.Cingular is currently selling these for $45 with a service contract, and I would take that deal if I weren't able to get mine for a reasonable price.  Conversely, I'd rather not have one issued by my company because that would leave me not a moment's privacy (people I have important business with know when it's appropriate to reach me by means other than my office phone or e-mail, and when it's not.)",4,An increadibly all inclusive device for people who need a lot but don't want to carry a lot.,1160870400,"10 15, 2006"

I received  this one as a gift from my friend and love it for two simple reasons:1) The sound quality is excellent. Despite the fact that it is very noisy in my car when I drive on the highway, I still can hear excellent. I actually do reduce volume on the headset because it has more volume potential than I need. I tried two headsets by Motorola in the past, including HS850. They also have volume button but even when you set to the maximum volume you can't hear well if you in a noisy environment. Plantronics provide you great quality and enough volume for any noisy environment. Also, everyone whom I talked to, told me that they can hear me very well, just like I speak without the headset.2) Reason number two - it sits perfectly on the ear. It is easy to insert it when you drive, and once it in, it stays there. It doesn't move at all. Unlike Motorola headset, that does not fall off but it moves on your ear and it takes a long time to get used to the fact that it is not falling off your ear. Plantronics also provides three different sizes of the pieces that you insert to your ear, makes it perfect to fit any size or shape.That is all I have to say. There is a good headset out there.

My hands-free-device turned into a pull-over-and-muck-with-it-after-each-call burden.  Maybe I didn't have some obscure setting correct but I looked all over and couldn't find one.  Maybe mine was defective, I'm not sure but it was really more trouble than it was worth.  In almost ten years of ordering from Amazon I am taking advantage of the return policy for the first time.I found a different headset at 73% off but still $40 (orig $150 / Plantronics Discovery 925 Bluetooth Earpiece in gold) and it comes with its own chargeable case.

Amazing in itself but you could barely tell the difference from ""all windows up"" and ""driver/passenger window down.""HOWEVER.... I wear glasses and have a rounder face.  It is difficult to place the earpiece on my ear with glasses on.  The bulky part doesn't sit well on my glasses' frame.  The mouthpiece is not adjustable.  I have fuller cheeks and the mic comes in contact with my face.  Not sure why it was made that way since not all faces are the same.  The control buttons are also difficult to manage while driving.  The main control on the side is fine but the tiny on/off and volume buttons were hard to find and press without dislodging the unit.  I turn it on before I place it on my ear.  Maybe that has something to do with it sitting on my eyeglasses frame. I do like the sound quality and will continue to use it for a while before coming back to update.

These are my initial impressions, and I compare this to the Motorola H680 as overall about equal, very similar to the findings by a major consumer-oriented organization as to these two Bluetooths.I gave my used H680 away to a friend of mine because she was driving me crazy always speaking to me over her speaker phone while driving.  She used the speaker phone out of necessity because in California you can not put the phone to your ear while driving, and her bluetooth's battery had died.  My friend is not mechanically adept and I would've kept the H680 otherwise.  It is smaller and more convenient to use than this Plantronics, but I feel the sound quality with this unit is better.  This unit takes some adjustment so I hope the following comments will be of benefit to those of you who purchase this unit:1.  Thoroughly read the instruction booklet.2.  Thoroughly read the instruction booklet.3.  Once you have thoroughly read the instruction booklet (it's not lengthy) and you get past setting it for your left ear (if that is your desire), the only major thing to do is to determine which of the three eartips is best for you.  This is important for comfort and I suggest that you start with the smallest tip and work your way up.  I am using the smallest tip-it works best for me.Though the unit appears to be somewhat awkward looking, it really is not uncomfortable on the ear if you accustom yourself to placing the eartip comfortably in your ear first (contrary to the booklet and as if the unit did not contain the curved attachment)-the rest will follow.Sound is crisper than with the H680, and appears louder.You can't go wrong with either, but I think I like this one more.Update:  1/7/10  Sound is definitely better with this unit, and it appears to hold charge longer than H680.  Voyager is definitely larger than H680.  When you get past that, and realize the benefits of sound quality and longer use on a charge, you might favor, as I do, the Voyager 510.

You can pair with 2 devices at the same time (I tried 2 phones, but I would like to add a phone and my laptop so I can take softphone calls on my laptop without an extended headset).I noticed that it disconnects from the phone after some time (less than an hour) of non-use. The first few days, I was always powering it off and on to re-establish the connection or going to the phone settings to reconnect and I was going to return it; however, one day I wanted to try pressing and holding the talk button for 2 seconds and bingo - it reconnects. So I don't have to power it off/on to reconnect.I am not sure if this is a feature of the iPhone or this device but I love the Voice Control - I press the talk button for 2 seconds to activate the Voice Control on my iPhone and I can say the number or name I want to dial and it dials for me. So now I am 100% hands-free while driving I use voice control all the time to dial people.I gave a 4 rating because this is not as comfortable as the Motorola H720 that I got for my wife (H720 is true over the ear headset - nothing going into your ear - you can read my review for that product on Amazon). Getting on the ear is a bit difficult - need 2 hands usually.For folks that want to listen to music from your iPhone/BBerry, please note that this headset is NOT A2DP enabled. i.e. you cannot stream music to your headset from your smartphone. If that is important for you, you can try Jabra BT8040 (I owned 8010 until I lost it, and I liked that - Plantronics or Motorola H720 voice quality was better than my old 8010 though).",4,"Good headset, thought not as comfortable as Motorola H720",1286236800,"10 5, 2010"

The battery life is wonderful usually outlasting a phone charge by a factor of two. It is generally compatible with just about all the regular phones.  If you have a Palm OS phone, pick a different headset as this MAY work, but has some issues that I find are difficult to live with.The good: This is a very durable headset (mine went through the washer and dryer and still works after it dried out for a few days).  The multiple options for ear pieces, flexibility of the design (switching ears without carrying extra accessories), compatibility with lots of phones, antenna design solving cross body communications for some phones, charging options with USB and power (you can wear it while charging comfortably), and battery life all are great. It connects to 2 devices at a time though you can obviously only answer one of them at a time.The Bad: (all minor) The wind smart does not work that great.  I have yet to find a bluetooth headset that can handle direct wind noise and this is no exception. It does better than most but remote parties still complain. Every headset I have tested fails here. This is difficult to distinguish between mute on the headset and power off. I tuned it off a few times on accident when trying to mute.  Oops. The mute also does not alert you frequently enough that it is on, but you can still mute from the phone separately without issues.

I would like to comment on the things I didn't see a lot of before I purchased.1.  Talk time: I'm on the phone 3000 to 5000 minutes per month as a Director of Business Development.  About 6 hours per day talk time is all you get.  Not good, not bad, pretty much on par with the other 3 BT Headsets I've owned. I will say that it seems this unit charges more quickly than the other I've owned.2.  I wear Glasses:  It fits Ok with them. The only problem comes when you remove your glasses with the Headset on; the Headset is prone to fly off. I can tell you that the unit is durable after several such flights.3.  Comfort:  I'm a ""big guy,"" 285 lbs.  Comfort didn't come quickly for me.  I still need to change ears a couple of times a day.  However, after around 30 days it is much better and I expect one day I'll not even know it is there.4.  Sound:  Good most of the time.  Better than the others I've owned.  Loud.  If you drive the highway this one works well.  Background noise is reduced but not eliminated; and unlike another background reducing Headset I own (from Plantronics also) there is no delay on call pick-up... nice!5.  Props to Plantronics.  By pressing the volume + key as you turn the unit on, the blinking blue light gets turned off (and on), this is important to me because people look like Cyborgs walking around blue blinking in public (not professional at all).6.

However, depending on how you plan to use it, it could either become a great headset or a nightmare.The first thing you notice out of the box is that it's quite large, both in the size of the battery pack that hangs over your ear and especially the depth of the microphone.  Put another way, it sticks out quite a bit from your cheek rather than laying flat against your face.  This not only can cause some sound quality issues, but also makes it very conspicuous.  So, if you prefer to keep a low profile while working hands-free, this may not be the best one for you.  The size of the piece that hangs over your ear also makes wearing glasses or even a hat an issue.  All that said, the unit is very comfortable provided you don't have anything else hooked over your ear.  It's also easily configured for either ear.Sound quality can be very good, but only in quiet environments.  Even small amounts of wind noise will render the microphone useless.  I've been surprised to have people complain to me that voicemails that I've left have been all broken up, even when I was in what I thought was a quiet place.I've also found that reception will be spotty unless the phone is placed closer than normal to the headset.  For instance, in order to maintain good signal, I typically have to have my phone in my shirt pocket.  But on the plus side, the unit is very easy to set up, with a variety of phones and PDAs immediately connecting to it with no effort.This headset would be ideal for someone who is looking to use it exclusively in an indoor office while working hands-free.  You'd get optimal sound and would be able to connect to all of your devices quickly and easily.  You wouldn't even feel self-conscious about the unit's size.  But for those on the go, its reception and microphone quality are too poor to recommend.PROS*  Excellent battery life means very little downtime for charging*  Simple to set up - instantly compatible with numerous devicesCONS*  Sound quality from the microphone, especially in places with even minimal background noise*  Big, bulky design makes fit difficult, especially with glasses or a hat",3,"Functional for the Right User, but Far From Perfect for All",1158019200,"09 12, 2006"
A97R2RMCBRVTY,B0009B0IX4,DrZ,"[0, 0]","This little ugly-ish set is still ruling the market with great sound quality for both its owners and people they talk to.  I have owned or tested several supposedly great Bluetooth sets with several different phones and devices including iPhone 3G, Motorola Razr and L6, Blackberry 7100i, two different laptops (Skype) and Playstation 3, and no other headset performed as well as Plantronics Voyager 510.In parallel with this device I had three different Jabras including BT250, BT500 and JX10 and neither one comes close to the sound quality and wind tolerance of Voyager 510.  I also learned of a number of users including my boss who switched from Jawbone 1 AND 2 to this or Discovery 925 set due to fit, comfort and sound issues, so I never even bothered to buy a Jawbone.  With Plantronics Voyager 510, people I talk to can't even tell I'm using a Bluetooth headset; not even when I'm driving, which I find amazing.  Since it's been over four years in my never ending quest for the perfect Bluetooth headset that I constantly keep researching and reverting to this little ""mule"", I just have to give it five stars in spite of its mainly cosmetic flaws.Here's why I got to appreciate this somewhat clumsy set so much:1. Good output volume and quality. When I'm using Plantronics Voyager 510, people I'm talking to can't tell I'm on a cell phone with a Bluetooth headset - not even when I'm driving (windows closed). The case was the opposite when I was using Jabras, when I used to hear complaints about noise, static and low volume of my voice.2. Good and controllable earphone volume. It can reasonably well deal with traffic noise when I'm walking outside my downtown Chicago office. I can set the volume really loud, so the only case when I cannot hear my partner is when I'm walking too close to a moving train. My usual volume setting is around 1/3.3. This set's microphone tolerates wind better than the Jabras mentioned above which used to produce a great deal of wind noise whenever I was encountering a breeze. In addition, if I know I'll be outside in a windy environment I can put the included microphone sponge on.4. Good battery life. I don't have to charge it often.5. Although it seems very light and gentle in my hands, it handles everyday folding and switching between my shirt pocket and both my ears very well.6. No problems with long usage, unlike Jabra BT250, which used to irritate the skin on the back of my ear if I used it too long or too often.I never heard about Plantronics before buying this headset and I grew to appreciate it a lot more after years of usage. Only recently I discovered that Plantronics has a long history with headsets and that even the Apollo missions used their headsets on the Moon. Makes sense.

So, I would not suggest considering anything under $100.Unless you consider this one.When I returned my first headset to Fry's Electronics I asked them what their most popular model was.  The sales guy said it was the Plantronics 510.  I tried it on and it felt really good.  I've been using it for about two months now and I love it to pieces.  It works as well now as it did the moment I bought it (actually, better, because it needed a charging).Positives:1)  Comfort.  This was the biggest attribute I was looking for as I wear this a lot.  After putting it on I usually forget it is there within two minutes.  It is light weight and very easy on the ears.  I only remember when somebody calls me and I hear the beeping in my ears.  With a flick of the wrist, this easily converts between the left and right ear and both feel extremely comfortable.2)  Sturdy.  I travel a lot and airports are not kind to any belongings, especially ones crammed into a bag.  But this thing has taken its lickings and keeps on going.  Must better than the first one I bought which fell apart over nothing.3)  Great sound quality.  I've used this at airports, casinos, and convention centers.  I can always hear my party without any problems and I've never had anybody complain that they can't hear me.4)  Simple to work.  Probably the most difficult thing about this is getting it recognized by the phone.  And that isn't complicated at all as that only took me 2 minutes, and most of that was searching for directions on how to do it.  Picking up the phone is as easy as hitting a button.On a side note, I have two Bluetooth cellphones and I can switch between the two automatically without any hassle.

Half the times I see it blink I think  I'm getting pulled over.  Also, it keeps blinking whether you are using it or not so I usually cover it with a hand towel when it is charging at night.  But this seems to be inherent of any bluetooth device.2)  Ummmm.... I can't think of any other negatives.So, I highly suggest checking this one out.  I can't say that this is for everybody because I've learned that no two ears are exactly alike.  The biggest thing I was looking for was comfort.  While this is completely comfortable for me it might not be for you.

A1HFQ2FKCXYME1,B0009B0IX4,Jeff Richardson,"[2, 2]","I've used the Plantronics Voyager 510 for a few months and have been quite satisfied with the length of the battery charge, reception, volume, and ability for others to hear me speak clearly.  The size of the headset is large compared to other headsets on the market and this is the only downside to this item.  Other headsets may look ""sleek"", ""chic"", or more ""cool"", but if good earpiece volume and clear transmission of your voice is critical, this is the headpiece for you.  If the size of the headset the goes behind the ear was slightly slimmer, I'd give it a full five stars.  The interchangeable earbuds are somewhat tricky to remove once installed.  That's the only other downside to this unit.  Otherwise, a great headset.  I enjoy mine a great deal.Update to my previous review (August 2010): After using this headset for over two years, I'm still fairly satisfied.  The only problems I've had was one of the earbuds was broken off after I mistakenly put the earpiece in my briefcase with several items the pressed against it.  Fortunately, there are two other earbuds included with the headset and I easily replaced the broken one.  Also, after a period of time, I've noticed the foam cover for the earbuds tends to split at the seam.  If you're purchasing this headset for the first time, it may be worth your money to buy and extra earbud/foam covers set.  Another problem is the headset momentarily disconnecting with my cell phone, then connecting back.  At this time, I don't know whether that is a result of problems with the headset or the phone.  Otherwise, it has served me well and I've yet to have had anyone tell me that my voice was difficult to hear or understand while conversing in a variety of noisy conditions.  Considering how long I've used this headset and it's performance to date, I can still recommend it to potential buyers.Another update to my previous review (September, 2010).  Since my last update, another issue has arisen with this headset.  The rubber material that houses the wiring and is the part that bends over your ear, has cracked in two areas.  One is closer to the top (near the on/off switch), the other is at the end of the rubber ""tube"" just above the earpiece.  At the latter location, the rubber is literally crumbling to pieces and exposing the wire cord within.  This is a very recent development and seems to be a part of decay based on age.  I realize after 2 1/2 years that no Bluetooth headset will look like new, but if this deterioration keeps up, a significant portion of the wire that runs from the battery to the earpiece/mic will be exposed.  When taking the construction into consideration, there's no way to replace this portion of the headset.  Short of wrapping the rubber in electrical tape (which would only give an unsightly and temporary fix), the only other solution is buying another one.  But, that doesn't make sense since the item is still in perfect working order, has a great earpiece with clear sound, and I've yet to have anyone complain about the quality of my voice through the mic, even when I was in a noisy environment.Final update to two previous updates (September, 2010).  The problem I wrote about in my last update has made me decide to never consider this model again.  The rubber portion that fits over my ear literally crumbled into several pieces two days ago.  Not only did this make the earpiece useless, but the wiring broke off from the circuit board that's in the piece that goes behind your ear.  Long story short, don't buy this model and expect to get several years of use.  If you're lucky and VERY careful in the way you carry, store, & use this item, you'll be lucky to get two years of use out of it.  Otherwise, I can't recommend it since there are so many other models that are equal to or better for less money.  I'll generously give it three stars...was tempted to give it only two, but the boom mic is an asset...noise reduction is better than average...but that's about all.",3,"Big in size, good performance, bad in long term use.",1209772800,"05 3, 2008"

Though it looks heavy, the unit is a featherweight and fits nicely around the ear. Long-term wearing is comfortable. Audio fidelity is excellent.Where the unit fails badly, though, is the controls. They do not provide enough tactile input. You cannot be certain of where the volume control is or which end of the rocker switch increases or decreases the volume. Since the volume defaults to moderately low setting, this means you are likely to miss the first words of whatever your caller is saying which in turn means a lot of asking ""what did you say?"".The Call Control button handles at least four different functions. On a phone equipped to handle all four functions, it is easy to mistakenly select a function. For example, on my phone, if I hold the Call Control button a fraction too long, the call is not answered, but the prompt to enter a Voice Speed Dial entry is actuated. No fun when you are trying to answer a call.Plantronics provides three earpiece inserts and it's unlikely that one of them won't provide a comfortable, snug fit.Overall, excellent technology marred by poor ergonomics.Jerry",3,Poor ergonomics mar this otherwise excellent Bluetooth headset,1173830400,"03 14, 2007"

Further, I keep my phone's ringer on 'silent' so coworkers don't know when I receive a phone call. The headset simply beeps in my ear, and I click it to take the call. If I am in a meeting or the boss is talking to me, I simply let it beep in my ear 4 or 5 times until the call goes to voicemail. No one even knows I had a call coming! If I am on the phone and someone important walks up to say something, I can easily stop responding to the person on my headset. They get the point pretty quickly, because they can hear the person I am talking to just about as clearly as I can!Now, if you want a nice quiet conversation in a cubical, you can scoot up close to a flat object (I use my flatscreen monitor) and talk in a very low voice. The sound reflects off of the monitor, so it is easier for your caller to hear your low voice volume without cupping your hand over your mouth piece or without trying to hold the mouth piece closer to your lips.I liked this so much I bought one for my wife. Her older phone (Motorola V557) drops the bluetooth signal much more often than mine does. Also, she goes outside more often than I do, and it seems like sunlight interferes with the bluetooth radio frequency. My wife loves keeping her phone on silent with the headset, because this way the baby doesn't wake up whenever a phone call comes in. My wife's complaint is that the signal gets dropped a lot, but she sometimes leaves the phone in the living room whenever she makes a quick trip to the bedroom - and that's just too far away.Next, I bought one for my dad.

A2ED50E3KWKUKW,B0009B0IX4,"KEN TELLS ALL ""Perfectionist""","[0, 0]",This is a really nice headset.  I got this to cut down on exposure to microwave transmissions. It is easy to use and works very good when wind exposure is low. With the increase in wind your voice is sometimes distorted and the person at the other end gets intermittent breakup of your voice. This happens with all Bluetooth headsets but less with this one. You can eliminate this problem by cupping your hand over the mic while talking. This blocks the wind from the mic! It is comfortable if you don't mind the loop part that goes over your ears. The bigger the ear lobe the easier it will stay on your ears and feel comfortable. I have moderate size ear lobes and it feels OK over my ear but takes time to adjust to feel comfortable. But it is about the best bluetooth out there. I have also bought a wired stereo headset by MEE -model M9P. This is a great product if you want wired small earbuds which sound real nice with your ipod and works great with 3.5mm jack cell phones!

Let me just say that my prior favorite was the Logitech but it was a little bulky and it disconnected from my phone after most calls (annoying).Having said that I now enjoy Plantronics Voyager 510.  The higher model, Discovery 640 doesn't stand a chance.  Yes the 640 is smaller, cooler-looking, but the features are not good.  The 640 has no windguard, no noice-cancelling tech, and the talk time is short.  The extra battery charger they give you and try to say that it boosts talk time does not.  You can't talk and charge at the same time.  Sheesh.OKay, so now with the Voyager 510, I love it.  Great fit.  It seems Plantronics has come out with a new version of the 510.  The foam mic boom is not removeable but is built in much like the logitech is.  The voice and sound quality are top notch.  I've recorded myself and it sounds clear.  I can even notice a difference with the noise-cancelling technology as the tv was on in the background, but my voice was still clear.  Noice-cancelling is important.Pros:Clear, audible soundMic is sensitive and my voice for callers are clearWind-GuardNoise-Cancelling technology (must have!)Fit - stays on confortably and they give 3 earphone-like inserts (perfect)Cons:the only thing is that the mic boom seems to rub up on my cheek or is very close so sometimes it will make a scratching sound for the caller (since it's rubbing against my cheek).

It is surprisingly comfortable considering the girth of the piece that goes over and behind the ear. My past headsets with earloops were horribly painful after a very short time, this one I can wear for hours, barely noticing it. It came with 3 different earpieces - one small, one large, and one teardrop shaped - so fit was not a problem. Sound quality is good enough that people frequently comment on how clear I sound and I am nearly always using it in the car. Wind cancellation really is insufficient, but this has not been a major issue for me...I just use it with the windows up or mostly up. I frequently leave this thing on overnight and still use it for a couple of days afterwards with no loss of power. Talk time is at least the 6 hours claimed and stand-by time can be measured in days.  Some people are troubled by the proprietary power cord, but it's a small matter as I have a household-type plug in my car and charge it while driving if need be, though it cannot be charged and used simultaneously.  I came here to see if I wanted to upgrade to another Plantronics model and pass this headset on to my daughter, but I think I'm going to keep it and buy her the same model.UPDATE:Still a 5 star item and I am on my second one.

I taped it with sports tape and kept using it without any problems, but I figured it was only a matter of time before it didn't work anymore so I replaced it.

It has performed very well.  People say they can here me as well if not better than when I use the phone itself.  I would recommend it.The one problem I sometimes have, in using it with my Motorola e815, is that it will sometimes become unpaired, randomly.  I believe it's specific to this phone as reported by others.  It seems to happen about a minute after 1 out of 20 calls.  I found sometimes it will pair to the phone again by quickly pressing the side button twice (which then causes the phone to redial, so you then need to end the call).  The other way is to turn the phone off and back on again.  The latest thing I tried is turning off the phone's powersave feature.  I've heard from others that that feature could be causing the problem, but we will see.  I probably should get a new phone anyway since mine is 2 1/2 years old.

AXLEZROKSR2M2,B0009B0IX4,R. McKown,"[1, 1]","The Plantronics Voyager 510 is a great headset for the right situation.  I've owned a 510 for three years, this latest one to replace the last one the dog chewed up (literally).The 510 is a comfortable headset with good battery life.  The quality of the audio I hear is very good, and the quality of the audio my callers hear is also very good.  However, the unit just returned would continuously send a low level static to callers, which wasn't the case with my prior 510.  I assume this was just a defective unit.The big strength of this headset is dealing with noise.  In comparison to the other two headsets I gave serious consideration, the Motorola H710 and the Jabra BT8040, the 510 had the best audio in all conditions.  One test was driving down the highway with all 4 windows down, the radio on at a moderate volume and the headset in the right ear.  Cabin noise was so loud that I felt the need to raise my voice level to hear myself.  I was able to hear callers over the noise just barely, and they could hear me, but did hear a lot of background noise as one would expect.  With the H710, I could hear callers well, but I was completely unintelligible to them.  The BT8040 was almost as good as the 510; callers heard me almost as well as with the 510, but I had trouble hearing callers because the audio was cutting in and out, as if echo cancellation was getting confused by all the noise.  All three worked quite well in quieter environments.  The H710 fails to cancel echo (of my voice back to me) when paired with a Uniden cordless land-line phone (with BT support).  The BT8040 fails to pair with the Uniden cordless phone at all.I ultimately kept the BT8040 and returned the 510 because of some shortcomings of the 510.  First, it is tricky to get on and off.  It took me a long time to figure out how to put it on using one hand, and it takes some fumbling.  It's far easier and faster to use 2 hands to put it on, but this is a hassle, and frankly looks stupid when you're doing it.  I don't like wearing it all the time because it is big and the darn blue light flashes all the time, grabbing the attention of others around you.  I feel like I'm on exhibit when I try to wear the 510 around others.  Finally, the 510 is not a good shape for keeping it in your pocket, and it's large enough that the phone and the headset in the same pocket isn't usually workable.  Which brings us back to the dog and the chewed up headset.  Because of its poor pocketability, I would tend to leave it on the desk or table when not in use.  Doggie finally figured this out.For use exclusively as a car or office headset, I'd pick the 510 over all three.  But for versatility in a wider range of uses, the BT8040 works best for me.",4,Strong performer with few weaknesses,1214956800,"07 2, 2008"

I drive a very noisy construction van so background noise is a serious problem. I have compared 8 different headsets and the Plantronics Voyager 510 is the only one that allows a clear conversation in this environment. I have used it daily for over 2 years and often for 6+ hours straight until the battery is dead. In a loud, dirty, construction environment, often lying on the ground, it's the only thing I've found that works. With the other models, either I, the caller, or both of us couldn't understand a word being said. For those of you that don't have background noise issues, I can add that even in quiet settings this unit has better sound quality than all the others that I tested. The way that I do my tests is to pair 2 headsets, put one in each ear and then switch between them while on the same call. This way I and the caller can compare the sound quality at almost the exact same time. The 2 cons I can mention are that the on/off button is too small and hard to push, and that when the battery is almost dead the buttons stop working (even though the sound continues fine) so you have to hang up using the phone instead of the headset. To be fair though, the ""almost dead battery"" symptoms happen in many of the other ones I've tested also. I don't care, sound is everything.",4,"A ""Sound"" Review",1205020800,"03 9, 2008"

A3H5L0UHVTW3CS,B0009B0IX4,SoCal Amazonian,"[11, 11]","I bought mine from Amazon cuz this was just about the lowest price I could find. Before I actually bought it I did some serious testing and reading about other headsets. I've tried Jabra 250, Jabra 500, Motorola HS850 and they all had one major problem - quite static-y. Actually the HS850 was a little better in this area than the Jabra headsets. I've had Jabra 250 for almost two years - static-y big time. If I put the phone in my left pant pocket and the headset on the right ear theres' noise all the time - this is not acceptable for me. The HS850, unlike the Jabra, has poor design. Any time I turn my head sharply this thing is flabbing on my ear as if it's going to fly out at any moment. This is why I wanted something better, not the same.I went on Amazon and read reviews on all kinds of headsets and my attention stopped on the Plantronics Voyager 510 from some company I'd never heard of. The the reviews were good. Even though my BestBuy store didn't carry it I decided to make the investment, buy it online and test it in the hopes to keep it.I received my headset, hooked it up to my phone - that was easy, no problem here.Then as soon as I started using it I noticed that there was no static, almost no static. I could keep my phone anywhere around me and there would be no static - a major advantage to the previous headsets.Then I noticed how easy it is to answer phone calls with it. the answer button is large enough, right against the ear, so I just had to press it against the ear using one finger. How cool is that?! The HS850 design was like that too but the Jabra 250 needed two fingers to answer one to support the headset and the other to press the answer button - I noticed with the new Jabra 500 that wasn't an issue anymore.The Plantronics is light, easy to put on, not flabby  - wraps around your ear pretty good.There's only a few things I didn't like about it and I hope the manufacturer is listening now:1. Picks up surrounding noise. If I am out people can hardly hear what I'm saying - even if there's hardly any wind. It's so bad that I've given up on using it outside.2. The ear bud needs to be tinier. I loved the small jelly-type of earpiece that Jabra had - you could hardly feel it in your ear.3. The power button is too tiny and hard to push. Not that this is a big deal because I hardly ever need to shut down my headset but it would be nice to have one that's larger still one that's not easy to hit by accident.I didn't give this review five stars because the headset needs to do a better job at fending off surrounding noise.Other than that, I highly recommend this headset.

A26ITT1SYI2M80,B0009B0IX4,"Stanley O. Chang ""stan1911""","[6, 6]","My first BT headset was a Motorola HS850.  Worked well until the recharge plug snagged on the socket and parts of the socket came out with the power plug.  So I replaced it with the Plantronics 510.  I wanted an earpiece that inserted into my ear as oppose to laying on top of my ear like the old World War 2 headsets of 50 years ago.  I sometimes am in noisy environments and the ""lay on the ear"" type is not designed to isolate loud distracting noises.  The HS850 was difficult for me to hook over my ear and took both hands at times.  Not so with the Plantronics, at least for me.  It goes on my ear much easier and the earplug type earpiece shuts out more of the noisy world attempting to interrupt my communications.  The earplug type earpiece also provides vastly improved volume.  I had to crank up the MOT to full and still had trouble hearing it at times.  Remember, I'm not in an office cube with carpeting and noise absorbing fabric cubicle walls, but in my truck on the highway or on the plant floor.  The clarity of the sound is excellent.  The volume level is more than adequate for me with several levels left to crank up the volumn if I need to.The headset is bulkier than my self destructed HS850.  The recharge plug pushes in with a friction fit as opposed to Motorola's press to unlatch type power plug (actually its the same charger that fits many Mot phones) that ripped the guts out of my HS850.I usually fold the Plantronics 510 into a flat configuration before droping it in my shirt pocket when Im not wearing it.  Folded, its slightly bigger than my previous MOT, but its advantage of putting it on my ear with one hand and the isolating abilities of its earpiece outweigh the small size advantage of the HS850.  And the friction fit recharge plug will never rip the guts out of this BT earpiece.I found the on-off button very easy to use, unlike the comments of many others.  I can very easily find the pointy button when the 510 is on my ear. Press for 3-4 seconds and it beeps to tell me its on.  2-3 seconds later a series of tones announces that it has connected with my Motorola i870.

A3BMK3DZDH0N6Q,B0009B0IX4,TechMSS,"[15, 15]","I have tried a few different bluetooth headsets, always looking for the Perfect Trifecta of (in order of importance): 1) great audio transmission quality in loud environments, 2) great audio reception (i.e. loud enough, no clicks or pops), and 3) comfort. The Plantronics 510 scores 5 stars for comfort, 5 stars for audio reception, but only 4 stars for audio transmission.To be fair, today's bluetooth headsets will never be as clear as the handset itself, or a wired headset, because bluetooth headsets sample at 8 KHz (i.e. 8,000 audio samples per second), while wired headsets and phones sample at 16 KHz (16,000 audio samples per second). That is why today's bluetooth headsets will always sound just a bit muffled.That said, as far as bluetooth goes, the Plantronics 510 does quite well -- but it has problems. I use it with my BlackBerry 8700. In a quiet environment, such as indoors or in a car with the windows up, audio transmission will be very clear. The boom mic brings the microphone closer to your mouth than do those tiny in-ear headsets, where the microphone is all the way up at your ear. (The microphone is about 3 inches from my mouth, compared to in-ear microphones, which are about 6 inches away.) The closer distance leads to a better, louder sound. However, in a noisy environment, everyone I've talked to finds it somewhat difficult to hear me because the sensitive microphone will pick up a lot of background noise. People have complained that they can hear the beeping of the checkout counter, or all the people chatting at Starbucks, or all the traffic noise, and it's hard to focus on what I'm saying. When I then disconnect the headset and talk directly into the phone, they all say, ""That's much better!"" That said, at least people can make out what I'm saying in a loud environment with this headset; with other bluetooth headsets I've used (e.g. the Motorola HS-820), loud environments render my relatively soft voice completely unintelligible.Audio reception is great when you're close to the phone; after about 5-10 feet away, you start to get clicks and pops. (Also, there are a fair number of clicks if I use the headset in my right ear while keeping the BlackBerry in my left pocket; my phone and headset need to be on the same side of my body, it seems, for the clearest sound.) The headset is very loud, and I usually listen to callers at about half-volume.In terms of comfort, Plantronics provides three styles of earbuds: small, medium, and a triangle-shaped larger one. After trying them all, I prefer the medium-sized bud -- I can keep the headset in my ear for over an hour without any discomfort, and sometimes I forget i am wearing it. Admittedly, it took me a while to figure out how to put in on with one hand, but I soon got the hang of it. It now takes me no more than 2 seconds to put it on. (Hint: Hold the earbud/boom-mic section with your thumb and middle finger, and lift the bulky back section up with your forefinger. Place the earbud in your ear, and then remove your forefinger and let the back section naturally fall back behind your ear. It sounds more complicated than it is, but it takes some getting used to.)I used to complain about the small power button, but then I realized that it's extremely easy to press down once the headset is on your ear. Contrary to popular belief, it is NOT a rocker switch; it presses down, but if you try to power on or off while not wearing the headset, it is tricky to find the right angle at which it needs to be pressed.So, bottom line: This is the best bluetooth headset I have ever used. When I am taking business calls at home and I want to sound as clear as possible, I either talk directly into the headset or use a wired headset with a boom microphone located 1-2 inches from my mouth -- but as far as bluetooth headsets go, the Plantronics 510 is extremely convenient for use when walking about town, or driving.

A1F9Z42CFF9IAY,B0009B0IX4,T. Tom,"[16, 16]","I've tried several different Bluetooth headsets from Motorola and Cardo, and ended up returning or giving away all of them. I kept the Plantronics 510 because it is simply the best I have ever tried. I hear no static, cracks or pops, the audio quality is tops both for me and the caller, and it's comfortable and doesn't flop around on my ear like other headsets do when I move.While the Plantronics may seem slightly larger than other headsets (mainly because it has a larger part that goes behind the ear), it is very comfortable to wear and use, and is very light. It slips into a pocket or bag just as easily as any other Bluetooth headset.The Plantronics 510 comes with 3 different sizes of earbuds to fit your ear perfectly and the speaker goes in (or very close to) your ear, unlike other headsets where the speaker just rests on the outside of your ear which is really not good for getting high volume in windy/noisy environments.  Also the Plantronics has a boom mic that folds down partway towards your mouth. This is way better than headsets where the mic is way up by your ear because the closer the mic is to your mouth, the better you will sound and the less background noise the callers will hear. Everyone I've talked to using this Plantronics have raved at how good I sound, especially compared to the crappy Motorola's I've tried previously.The Voyager 510 has great battery life both while talking and on standby. The Bluetooth range is superb-I can very effectively walk all around my condo from room to room, talking on the phone, yet my cellphone remains on my computer desk-it really goes 30 feet, and through walls too.  And the fact that this headset can even remember pairing with multiple devices is icing on the cake.I really recommend this headset. It's money well spent. Or go ahead and try others, but it would be my educated guess that you will end up with this one eventually, like I did.*There is a slightly misleading bit of text in the instruction manual with regards to charging that you should be aware of: It states that the LED will illuminate Red while charging and illuminate Blue when done charging.

Tough to say whether these disconnects are phone or headset related. I think this is a great value for the money though and prefer it over the Motorola's and Jabra's (better fit, louder sound).

A1QOK9LU90ACF7,B0009B0IX4,"William W. Davis ""famousdavis""","[14, 14]","On the strength of the very high rating and huge reviewer feedback here on Amazon, I bought this Bluetooth device -- my first bluetooth headset ever.  I finally have a phone that has Bluetooth capability, and I was keenly interested in a wireless headset that wouldn't have the cord tangle issues of corded headsets.This device does exactly what I wanted it to do.  It was a piece of cake to setup on my Verizon Samsung u540 phone.  You wouldn't even need to crack open the user manual except to discover the 4-digit code you have to plug-in to your phone (it's 0000, btw).  After that, it's a snap to turn on and link to my phone.My other important concern was voice clarity, both on sending and receiving.  Thus far, after several hours of use, I can tell you that the voice reception I hear is crystal clear.  No crackling, no hollowing or echoing.  On the other end, I've not had anyone complain about being unable to hear my voice or that my voice is coming across muddled -- interestingly, I've had such complaints while using my old, corded headset!The power button *is* small and it *is* a tad more difficult to depress than you might want, but then, you won't accidentally turn on or turn off this device because of the way it's designed.  I agree with others -- turn on the device before putting it on your ear, and do the same when you're turning it off.As for noise canceling, my wife and I tested out this device in very noisy home with four small kids, and I was very pleasantly surprised at how well this headset communicated my voice but not the ambient noise in the room.Using the volume control on the headset was pretty easy to do.  Note that you can control voice volume either through the phone handset volume control or the control on this Plantronics headset.  If other reviewers are complaining about low volume from this headset, it's likely because one of the two volume controls is turned down too low, or perhaps the mobile phone their using doesn't have much by way of signal output.  This Plantronics headset has *plenty* of loud volume if that's what you want.As for ear comfort, I found it to be very comfortable, although I haven't worn it all day long.  I talked to a friend for an hour yesterday, and I had absolutely no discomfort at all.  The device comes with three earpieces (small, medium and large).  I use the medium with great results.The phone fits snuggly on my ear and it doesn't move around at all, although I'm not jogging or even walking much while using it.I like the more discreet look of having the ""guts"" of this device behind my ear, with a thin microphone on the side of my face, rather than the fat Motorola designs.Other reviewers have cautioned about the headset breaking, so I just take very gentle care while handling it.  I suspect I won't have a problem with it falling apart.I can't speak to battery life, because after a lengthy phone call, I just recharge it so it's ready for the next call I might make.  Charging it is easy to do and doesn't take long, either.In sum, I'm very satisfied with this device.  As long as it doesn't break, it's performance and comfortable design make this an excellent choice.",5,Works as expected - Easy to use,1177977600,"05 1, 2007"
A30Z0GG96D11EO,B0009B0IX4,Wisdom Twin,"[0, 0]","So we purchased this headset because of all the mostly wonderful raving reviews.  For the first hour when my husband called me it sounded perfect.... I didn't even know that he had it on.  I breathed a sigh of relief.  Then he calls me later on and it is extremely choppy... the next day he is barely discernable and everytime the phone rings, I can't even hear him.We are confused... it sounded perfect and then it went kaput.  He didn't drop it!  The only thing that he can come up with is that he was sweating because we were having a heat wave in NYC and maybe that messed it up.  The sweat; that is!So I called Amazon, they sent me a new one which we will be trying out today.  I even called Plantronics at Amazons' suggestion just to make sure that it wasn't an issue on our end.  The verdict is that their customer service is exceptional!  Very helpful and took the time to understand my concerns.  We reset and resync'ed and still it sounds horrible.  Our phones are the Sprint Samsung Instincts.  Plantronics said that they do not have them on their list and they are still in the beginning testing phase and that may be the issue.So, I gave it 3 stars for the first hours of use.

A5JLAU2ARJ0BO,B0009FCAJA,"Gadgester ""No Time, No Money""","[8, 10]","I bought this RAZR v3 phone in July to go with my 7-Eleven Speak Out Wireless prepaid service.  The phone I received from Amazon.com was made for the Hong Kong market, so it came with a outlet plug adapter for U.S. customers.  (The AC adapter itself is universal voltage, and the slim paper manual is in English.)  The phone is quadband and fully unlocked, so it can be used anywhere in the world.I really like the RAZR phone.  It's very solid and the voice quality is excellent.  Speak Out Wireless runs on AT&T; and T-Mobile networks so the reception quality can vary, but overall the RAZR does an excellent job in pulling in as much signal as possible.  As with other Moto phones, the brightness of the screen can be adjusted, and the ringer type and volume can be easily changed.  The metallic keypad takes a little getting used to, but is pretty comfy to use.The camera is only VGA but takes good-quality pictures when there's plenty of light.  Video capture is jerky and limited to 15 seconds, so that's probably the weakest feature for me.  Bluetooth linkup to a Sony Ericsson earpiece works fine.  Battery life is admirable; I don't use the phone much, maybe just 10 minutes a week, and I need to recharge it once every 8 days or so.Because I've owned many Moto's before so I like the RAZR's interface, since it feels familiar, but I can understand how it can confuse users new to the Moto scene.  Overall, though, I don't think it's harder to use than a Sony or Nokia.What really impresses me is the build quality of this phone.  Nowhere can you find out where this thing is made, but the material and fit and finish are excellent.  I'm very happy with this inexpensive purchase.",5,I really like it,1188864000,"09 4, 2007"

A3KZCNV1N8R9GC,B0009MYS9S,diljs,"[44, 44]","These are some decent headphones, but if you use them they WILL break.  It's only a matter of time.  I did some research and found the following tips to prevent/fix the breaking:Solution #1:Put the band portion of the headphones in boiling water for a while and slowly spread them open. Once you have them opened up some take them out of the water and let them cool while holding them in the spread position. This reduces the tension of the headphones against your ears and reduces the stress put on the headphone band. This results in two advantages, less pressure on your ears resulting in better comfort and no cracking of the band.If you stretch them to far they will fit too loose and will lose some of there bass effect. But all you have to do is reheat them and close them up a little until you get the fit you want.Solution #2:Even if your headband has broken in two this will still work. It will only take a little patience and $5.00 of materials from a local hobby shop.Materials:- 3/4 inch or 1 inch nylon tape (all hobby stores that have RC Plane materials have this)- CA (cyanoacrylate) the stuff that superglue is made of but I recommend getting some real CA at any hobbystore. Get the ""thin"" stuff.- Saran Wrap. yes the sandwich stuff...- ScissorsSide note: I call the nylon tape ""tape"", but it is really just a ribbon of nylon. There is no sticky stuff on the ""tape""1) First if your headset has snapped completely in two use a little CA to mend it as best as you can. It doesnt need to be perfect but just mended enough that it is technically one piece again and headphones are seperated to where you want them to be.2) Next cut off a 6 inch piece of the nylon tape and using a VERY small amount of CA, tack the top edge of the tape to the BACK of the band where the crack has occured (which should be exactly in the middle of the band in most cases). Use just enough so it sticks as you don't want too much CA getting into the ribbon. It should be hanging down now in the back like a tail. Note: Use the saran wrap to help hold the tape in place as you are tacking it in place as you DO NOT want this stuff to get on your fingers...3) Once the CA has dried enough and the tape is stuck, wrap the tape under and around the band one time until the tape is hanging down again in the back. Pull the tape VERY tight and use a little bit of CA at the top to keep it in place.4) Wrap around one more time and tack it again one more time making sure to always keep the tape tight when you tack it. You should have wrapped the tape around twice at this point. If your set was broken completely in two you may want to wrap one or two more times and at a slight angle to cover a little more area. When done, use some scissors to cut off the excess tape at a point so the cut end of the tape is at the back.5) Now you can saturate the whole band of tape with CA. Use the saran wrap to press down the cut end of the tape as you glue and it will end up perfectly flat. This is an incredibly strong fiberglass patch similar to carbon fiber. The patch will have a very small profile (not that thick) and be similar in color to scotch tape, however it could easily be painted to match the color of the headband if desired.There you have it. This is a permanent and SOLID fix and only takes about 5 minutes. I'm wearing mine right now after i just fixed them. Also you can do this (and I strongly suggest you do) to a set that has not cracked yet, because they WILL NOT CRACK if you do. Just do it exactly in the middle of the band.",4,Prevent your headphones from breaking,1157673600,"09 8, 2006"
A12K45UBPC7R7Q,B0009MYS9S,Ed Perkins,"[6, 6]","I purchased this unit a few weeks ago from one of Amazon's 3rd party vendors. I got a very good deal, but the trade-off was that it came in a bag with no instructions. I went to the Logitech website and got things going.The pros:1) No wires, and the batteries last about 7 hours (I tried using them all day at work)2) The sound is good enough. (I had been using a Shure e3, which finally broke for good out of warranty). This unit is not near as loud or as bassy as the Shure, but they don't fall off while I'm on the treadmill either.3) Worked well for watching TV in private.The cons:1) Seems to need it's own bluetooth transmitter. My Powerbook bluetooth connected but the sound was so scratchy and bad that it was unusuable. Plug in the supplied transmitter and everything was fine.2) The headband is not adjustable and my ear feels bruised after wearing them for an hour. The time I wore them all day at work won't be repeated.The headband is almost a dealbreaker. If it wasn't for that, I'd be using these headphones all the time.3) The unit is kind of like those watches that use one button for multiple purposes. The button on each part does something different depending on how long you hold down the button. After a couple of days I got the hang of of, but the button on the transmitter is so small, that I have to stop doing anything but holding the button down to turn it off.Overall, I'd say wireless on a treadmill is worth the ear bruising. I can't count how many times I've accidentally hit the cord with my arm and sent my iPod flying across the room. I like to watch videos on it while on the treadmill and the bluetooth headphones make that a pleasant experience instead of constantly trying to watch the cord.

I almost deserted them to get the phone, but in mid-June, I finally got my Verizon branded Treo 650. It has not been a great experience.First the positives. It is very cool to have all my contacts, all my appointments and todo items on my phone. While the phone is large by today's cell phone standards, it is a great looking unit and functions well. It is easy to set up email and web access and it is great to be able to stay in touch with the normal too-much-email office when I am traveling.However, it is not all great news. First, I have had a heck of a time keeping the unit synchronized with my office Outlook. I get duplicates by the tons and, worse, deleted contacts. The dupes are somewhat tolerable to deal with, but losing contacts, which slip into my deleted Outlook folder is not acceptable. No one has been able to tell my why this is happening.Second, the reception and volume of the phone are horrible. Where my old Motorola TC30 could get calls in awful reception areas, the Treo is spotty inside my own house. I lose calls in transit and while sitting still. Worse, the volume is very faint. I purchased a software tweak called VolumeCare which slightly amplifies the wimpy sound from the phone, but distorts it as well. About the only acceptable solution is to use a headset and plant that sound right in your ear! Not a convenient or very affordable solution.All-in-all, I'm disappointed in the Treo. It has some nice features, but it is very disappointing as a phone.",2,Very disappointing phone,1130716800,"10 31, 2005"

I bought it just to be an organizer, phone, mp3 player--in that order--so I can't speak to other features such as web access (currently an expensive $45 from Verizon).Two pieces of advice:1. Budget several hours to set up.  It's nearly like buying a new computer.  I had to transfer my calendar and contacts from my old Cli&eacute; and found that some of my old Palm applications caused the Treo to restart (I promptly deleted them). Generally it was just tedious software stuff, including a tricky firmware update from the Palm website, but don't expect to be ready out the door.2. Before you buy, budget for accessories.  After purchasing the following: case ($20), SD card reader ($10; for the easiest transfer of files to the SD card), 2GB SD card ($150), 2.5MM-compatible headphones ($17), 2.5MM>3.5MM headphone adapter ($10), extra sync cable ($13), mp3 player application ($15; the RealPlayer is clunky and doesn't have a graphic equalizer), I have nearly spent as much as the device itself!

It was a 'free' phone and the phone company wished they could nickel and dime us forever through their 'plans' and and make us pay various monthly service fees for the privilege of downloading a couple of songs or uploading photos or videos we made using the phone's camera. The Sony Ericsson's phones lacking a standard USB interface is probably intimidating enough to persuade most users to succumb to the phone company's demand of an extra $10 or more per month for 'web' access. But it does not need to be this way.Since we only wanted a phone that made phone calls this inexpensive wire allows us to squeeze some extra functionality off our free phone by allowing us to transfer media files in and out of the phone by connecting it to a computer. It's easy, it requires no software installation and we don't need to pay one extra dime to the phone company for the privilege.Positives:- eliminates the need to pay the phone company for an Internet connection- no software installation required- file transfer is actually faster- allows for easy media files transfer to and from OUR computer - all DRM-free files can be easily send to the phone- even users who have an Internet plan may appreciate the ability to connect their phone directly to their computerConcerns:- some minimal computer skills are expected - such as the ability to recognize specific file types and copy or move them to/from specific foldersConclusion: recommended to any Sony Ericsson phone user, with or without a media or Internet plan.",5,The wire 'they' wish you didn't have,1247702400,"07 16, 2009"

It's a snug fit, to be sure, but a little too snug. After a recent lengthy phone call, my ear was so fatigued from being squeezed for so long, it gave me a headache. There is no way to take the snug tension down a notch.

A1YPD7WYMZX083,B0009W8DL2,D. Snedigar,"[7, 7]","My wife and I both purchased the BT350 on suggestion from a Verizon rep with our new phones. She got a Treo650 and I got the LG8100.Pairing the device was relatively easy, once you followed the written instructions. However, we've both had problems with the headset staying paired with our phones on a couple of occassions, and have to run the pair-up process again.When they work, the sound is pretty good. But most of the time, they don't work very well at all. And for the record, typicall my headset is with 3-4 feet of my phone - and I've had the same problems when it's less than 2 feet away with perfect line of sight.My wife and I almost never can call each other using our headsets and connect on the first try. Oh, it will call and we'll try to answer, and it will sound loud and usually clear - but one of us can't hear the other 99% of the time - at all. It's a series of ""hello-hello? HELLO?"" Forcing us to hangup and call again. Then we usually are connected.When we do connect, the sound typically has some static, minor digital echoing, and/or frequent dropouts such that you can't hear what the other party is saying. It's very annoying - almost like when you try to fake that your getting bad reception on your cell phone an...it...sou...ds..li..is.The one button feature is ok once you figure out what the various presses on it do. I've never had to adjust the volume buttons, but they are basically up and down.More annoying is the continuously strobing blue LED on the main button. When the headset is powered on, the button flashes. When you are actually using the headset (connected to a call) the button flashes faster. This confuses people when you are wearing it - because it appears to them that you must be using it since it's flashing. But it's always flashing! So if you are a person who uses it a lot and doesn't take it off very often, that can cause a problem.Even MORE of a problem is driving with it at night. For a week, I drove home in the dark with my headset, and found myself constantly turning my head to look for emergency vehicles as I kept seeing this blue strobe out of the corner of my eye. But of course when I turned my head, it was gone. I finally figured out it was the reflection of my headsets indicator light reflecting off the windows! That can't be good.On the plus side - it is very lightweight and easy to wear on either ear. It comes with an AC and a USB charger - which was great since I could charge it at work or with my laptop. It seems to hold a charge very well for long periods. I know I've gone an entire week without recharging. The range seem pretty good - though I usually never get beyond a few feet from my phone.Even though I can't take this headset back, I'm purchasing another one because this one is pretty much useless if the intent of it's design is to have a simple to operate, hands-free and safe method of communicating with your cell phone.

It turned out to be absolutely smooth when connecting to my Samsung. The headset can flash and even vibrate when call's coming.The headset is amazingly light weight.

A1N5FSCYN4796F,B0009W8DL2,"Philip R. Heath ""Gadgets, Music, & Books""","[13, 13]","Your first question is what other headsets am I comparing this to. See my reviews of the Motorola HS850, Jabra BT250v, Plantronics 320 Explorer for reference. Now let's consider this headset in terms of the four key performance categories: pairing, sound quality, ease of use, and comfort.Pairing - I was able to pair this headset with my LG VX-9800 on the first try. The instructions in the manual are straightforward so I will not repeat them hear. The experience is similar to what I had with the BT250v.Sound Quality - This is really the top area to question with a headset. I'm happy to report that this headset delivers nicely in this area. I am able to use less than the max volume setting in most cases which is definite progress over the other headsets I have used. On the other end, it is important that you don't have the volume louder than you need it because otherwise people hear an echo of themselves due to the close proximity of the speaker to the microphone. However, I have found the echo to be less of an issue than it is on the HS850.Ease of Use - The key to a Jabra headset is holding the multifunction button down until it flashes. This turns the headset on and off after pairing. You will hear reports of people winding up redialing the last number called when trying to turn the headset off. If you don't wait for the flash, this will happen. I've also heard this reported during pairing, but that shouldn't be the case because you start pairing with the headset turned off. Finally, the volume buttons are easy to use. I only use the headset on my right ear so I can't speak to what it is like when the headset is flipped over and the buttons are on top.Comfort - I also found this headset to be the clear winner in the area over the other three that I have used. I wear glasses so the over the ear hook is a necessity. I think that they have also hit the sweet spot on placement of the speaker. The speaker is raised from the surface of the headset as opposed to the HS850 which is flush with the main body of the headset. However, it does not go into your ear like the BT250v or the Plantronics 320. I guess another way to put it is it rests just outside of the ear canal so the speaker is as close to being inside your ear without actually being so. I think that this maximizes comfort and contributes to the better sound quality. Finally, the vibrate feature is very disturbing if you are not used to it. Don't let that stop you though because it is something that you can turn off if you so desire.",5,Best Bluetooth Headset I've Ever Used!!,1155859200,"08 18, 2006"

They include vibrating alert (I've turned it off), call accept and call decline (much needed).  It also allows you the opportunity to automatically call the last number dialed. The voice dialing also works great.  I was not able to record the name through the BT350, but once recorded, the phone recognized the name when spoken through the BT350.

It dropped audio connections while dialing, or after 20 minutes of conversation. (Replacement unit has also exhibited this, but less.) Contacted Jabra about the charging issue, they required that I a) return the headset under an RMA, and THEN they will b) send me a new one. After less than a month of use. I found another way to get a replacement (boomerang purchase at a local chain 'tronics store.)On the plus side, it lasts on standby for a few days (vice a few hours like my Sony BT headset does). It fits around my ear, and comfortably in my ear, very easily. The loop is soft rubber, so no sharp or rigid plastic is clamping on your outer ear. If the sound is not quite loud enough (the volume controls are easy to find by touch, but this in-ear speaker can only blast so much), the earbud can be gently pressed in to form a seal, and is easier to hear this way. Sound is so-so, some callers have told me they can't hear me if there's ambient sound, music, wind, or cars nearby. In all, better than average, but this is the second Jabra product that's crapped out on me, so be wary. (I recommend always owning a wired headset as a backup, and particularly for business or important personal use.)** JULY 2008 UPDATE **I've now used this for 2 years and can give it a much better review. The unit has held up well (though the tip broke and had to be glued back). It still holds several hours charge, where my old Sony headset now lasts one 10 minute conversation and dies. The shape, weight, and ergonomic fit are so unobtrusive that I've had some companions remind me I'm still wearing it after hanging up on a call. Although I didn't like the shiny ""bling"" microphone tip, I've now softened on this design. The BT500 is still more attractive and less attention getting than others. Because I have a headset at work, and my new car has a HandsFreeLink feature, I use this unit at home, and after two years, it still works great. I recommend this headset without reservation.

Plus I need the headset to stay put even when I'm lying on the ground, sideways, etc. This over and behind the ear style works well for me. I tested all 8 headsets by pairing two at a time and putting one in each ear, then switching between them while on the same call. This let me and the caller compare the sound quality equally from both sides of the call. In a nutshell, the Jabra BT500 wins on function and the Plantronics 510 wins on sound quality. Given that background noise is such a big issue for me, I have to go with the 510. The BT500 has better designed buttons that both feel and work better. But, the sound problems are: 1) The BT500 always sounds slightly more muffled, even in a quiet environment 2) The BT500 has the mic so close to your face that it often touches and makes noise, especially when trying to use a button and 3) in a noisy environment the Plantronics 510 wins hands down. With the kind of background noise I get, I couldn't use the Jabra BT500. I have to go with the Plantronics Voyager 510 and all the other issues have to take a back seat to the sound. For those that would use this in a quiet environment I can say that the sound quality is only slightly worse than the 510 and may not outweigh the better function of the BT500.",4,Jabra BT500 vs. Plantronics Voyager 510,1205020800,"03 9, 2008"

This is a great phone with a pretty intuitive interface (though, that doesn't go for the Verizon version from what I've seen). The one downside is that call volume could stand to be louder, especially if one is in a crowded area. A bluetooth headset effectively eliminates this problem.Speaking of bluetooth, I was supremely impressed by how open Cingular left the bluetooth options (again, the Verizon interface differs in this respect). You're able to transfer any wallpaper, ringtones, and videos on and off with ease.The only hurdle is pairing the phone for the first time. The trick is to initiate pairing on the PC while the bluetooth connection is active. For example, send a file from the phone to your PC (using the ""copy"" function while a file is selected) and quickly initiate pairing from your PC.

A1UCW6CLGN1P3X,B000A1329U,Andy Blanza,"[8, 8]","I bought this phone because of its sleek and stylish design. PROS and CONS:CONS: 1. The phone feels fragile and gets smudged easily. I find myself wiping off oils and finger prints constantly. Due to it's price, I would recommend purchasing the extra warranty on the phone from Cingular due to the risk of damaging the phone. 2. I find that in speakerphone mode, the call is almost inaudible while driving on the highway. I wish it could be louder. 3. The menu is complicated. The contacts must be entered as one entry, which is annoying if you have more than one phone number for a contact. 4. The phone doesn't have a setting to disable the roaming function. 5. The phone makes a buzzing sound near electronic devices (TV, computer, radio, etc.).PROS: 1. I have a bluetooth enabled PDA and I can transfer pictures from the PDA to the phone (and vice versa). Perfect for sharing photos or using graphics for wallpaper or picture caller ID 2. Battery life is long. 3. Video function is not that great, but is nice. 4. Audio is also better than a Sanyo 8200. 5. The phone doesn't feel heavy inside the chest pocket. All in all, not a bad phone.

It feels extremly sturdy, and while it is not a tiny phone, it is very thin. It weighs more then you would expect, but I don't mind because it feels a bit more well made.I had an off version of the Motorola V557 that I have had for well over a year now. I got it free, so I gave it up to a friend who needed a phone badly. I am a cingular customer. I was wanting a new phone anyways and it worked out well.I got the Nokia 6102 about one or two weeks ago. I have to say while it is a good deal for the price I just didn't like it at all. So I returned it and got the razr. I spent a bit more on the razr, but it was reasonable. (...).The razor is simple phone, a good phone. It comes in a very pretty case that will make you happy each and every time you open it! It has a good quality camera (it's NOT a digital camera, its more like good quality web cam) and I find it very easy to read, and dial because everything is so clear and spaced out nicley.I got the black version, and I nick named it KIT after the night rider car, it reminds me of it.

If you plan on connecting to the internet using this phone and bluetooth you had better get a mongo battery for your laptop because it's the slowest, laggiest, painfully irritating, useless piece of doggy doo that I have ever had the displeasure of using! You could run to Seattle and knock on Amazon's front door faster than connecting to the site.Update: 6/7/2006I tested the actual bandwidth and I connect at 39.1 kbps, that's slower than dialup with a 56k (53.3) modem. When connected to Cingular's GSM it says connected at 115.2 kbps when I connect via bluetooth and 230 kbps when I use the USB cable. Either way the actual speed is 39-41 kbps and I surely don't have the patience for that.One last annoying feature ...

Even with these cons it is still eons ahead of other phones.EDIT: Change from 5 stars to 1 star...  I loved the features on the phone and the flip lid was great.

AVK9BSXJJ51I8,B000A1329U,S. Allen,"[0, 0]","Oct 7th 2005If you look carefully at these so called ""bad reviews"" you will notice most of them either don't know how to use the phone OR may have been the 1-2 out of 1000 that received a faulty phone which happens from EVERY manufacturer, EVERY brand, EVERY type of phone.Now my wife & I have had ours for 12 days so far with no problems whatsoever, we ordered 2, I got the Black one she got the silver one. Got BOTH for FREE btw.Just a word about those of you like us that want a ""shared plan"" from Cingular BUT Amazon does not offer those plans while you order, I ordered 1 phone with 1 cheapest single plan each, now when Amazon sends you the conformation that your order has been shipped you get your ""Cell phone Numbers"" right then in the email.I simply called Cingular gave them the phone numbers of each phone told them the deal and had the service changed to a ""single 700 rollover mins shared plan"" before we even got the phones in our hands, so there is no problems at all in that respect. Once we got the phones I called back to check and yes the person from Cingular had done everything as asked, I also checked from the phone itself as you can go to ""My Account"" from the Main Menu page and phone goes online and checks everything about your account, how many minutes, the plan, when the next bill is due, etc etc, and sure enough everything was as it was supposed to be.As far as signal strength it is excellent in my area, I can go all through our house upstairs and downstairs and it stays between 4-5 bars, I don't recall seeing less than 3 bars all around town so far, the phone gets a great signal, and Cingular ""in my area"" puts out a great signal.My wife just came back from a business trip, she was about 150 miles away ""With NO ROAMING charges"" btw our last cell phone service ""Alltel"" would have been roaming within 20 miles.Anyway when she got to the hotel she called we both had perfect signal strength, we both put phone in ""Speaker Phone"" mode and she just laid the phone in closed position on the night stand while she unpacked her suitcases, I put mine on my night stand and we talked for about an hour with no problems at all, and it was a FREE call ""Mobile to Mobile"".We sent a couple text messages to each other that worked no problem.She used the phone as her Alarm clock the next morning which worked perfectly.Now as for what 1-2 reviewers have said about the battery life, most likely they have gotten one of those 1-2 out of 1000.I've had phone 12 days have charged it 3 times and have never let it go to the point where is says it ""needs"" charging, so average 4 days per charge and just like the manual states it appears as though battery life is getting a bit better after a few charges, So I'm easily going to get 3-5 days per charge, and that's with a lot of fiddling around with it because it's new and 1-2 hours talk time.Some one mentioned they dropped the phone on its hinge and it broke. I have yet to drop the phone but it seems to be very well made to me, either way I would suggest getting a Krusell cover for it which I did but has not been delivered yet, and also insurance for $4.99 a month from Cingular which covers anything and everything for life of the phone, thus that problem is solved.Someone mentioned something about the ""address book being slow"" not even sure what that means, I only have about 8 numbers in it so far but it comes up virtually instantly for me, maybe if you have 100++ numbers in it might take a couple seconds? dunno.As for searching through the phone book, they mentioned you have to make a new entry for each number for same person, NO you dont, you have the option to show numbers any way you wish, either by ""Name"" or ""Speed dial #"" or ""Voice name"" or even by ""Email"" and with or without a picture of the person.Want it faster and easier if you have a lot of names/entries? then set it for ""list only"" ""no picture"" and by ""primary number only"", simple. You can also separate numbers even further by putting in ""Categories"" such as ""Business/Personal/General/VIPs""Bring up Category your number is in only that way even if you have 100s of Names & #s it thins them to category.When you have ""primary number only"" listed all you need to do then to get all the other numbers & Email listing for that Name is to ""Highlight name and use left or right on the Navigation button to get all the other numbers"" once again very simple and easy to use. I find the Phone book to be excellent & fast.1-2 have mentioned something about ""ear piece volume too low"" I'm in total agreement with ""Harry G from TN"" the ear piece volume is fine just make sure the ""volume"" is turned up and it is just a good as any other cell phone I have ever used, but like Harry mentioned make sure your ear is right at the ""top edge of the phone"", too low and volume will sound low.Now myself I find the phone overall to be excellent, gets a great signal, has way more than enough features for me, works very well for its intended purpose ""PHONE"" seems to be very well made, nice size, looks great, has a really nice screen with sharp image & colors.I have only ONE complaint so far......The screen which looks outstanding inside under any indoor lighting, especially if you are in the dark, well that same screen outdoors under ""sunlight"" is virtually unreadable. So there you have my one gripe.I will come back and update this if anything changes, but as for right now and for FREE and can hardly see how you can go wrong with this phone.(Update 4/30/06.)Well 7 months later and these phones are still working flawless with ZERO problems of anykind.I charge it maybe twice a week so battery life is still great.Neither my wife or I have this alleged sound problem some seem to have the earpiece and speakerphone volume are plenty loud.My wife is constantly playing solitaire on hers, so she has worked the hell out of that keypad the last 7 months and no problems.These phones are the best we have ever had by far, so like I said before take these ""bad reviews"" with a grain of salt.Some may indeed have a faulty unit which is going to happen regardless which phone you buy, but I bet a large percentage of these problems are simply operator error.These phones are excellent and I would recommend them to anyone.Still the only slight fault that I can gripe about on them is the screen is hard to see in bright sunlight.and it took an extra couple weeks to get rebate but was no problem, just a single phone call and problem was solved.(Update June 23th 2006)Have had these phones over 9 months so far without a single problem, they work flawless.As I said above anyone giving this phone a bad rating either has that rare bad one of the bunch or simply doesn't know how to use the phone. I have dropped this phone 3X so far, last time was 4 days ago in the parking lot on concrete and no problems at all, not even a scratch. (Of course the Krussel case is outstanding and helps a lot)We used both our phones while on a Cruise to the Caribbean and as long as we were in an area/Island that had cell service we had good reception and no problems at all, and as long as we were in a US territory (Puerto Rico, St. Thomas, St. Croix, St. John) the calls were not roaming.You get the phones for FREE, Amazon is good to order from with no problems, Cingular so far for us anyway have been very good and the service (in our area) is far better than what Alltel was.There may be some phones out there as good, some im sure will have a better camera, however I seriously doubt you will find a better all around cell phone & service.",5,"Look carefully at ""bad reviews""",1128643200,"10 7, 2005"

If you don't mind jumping through 50 million hoops to get it, well go for it but if your time is money, run from this rebate and this phone.  5 co-workers in my office thought we would take advantage of this offer and what we thought would be a cool, hip cell phone.  How wrong we all were.  Cingular is fine.  They have their issues like all the cell companies now for customer service but it is the phone itself & the rebate program that was an issue for ALL 6 of us.  3 people had problems with the buttons on the phone and had to send them back before they even got their rebates.  The acutual rebate thats up to 4 months to receive and that is only if you have correctly jumped through all of the hoops.  One mistake and you are screwed out of the $150 rebate.Another problem with the phone and it's limited features is that other than the initial tone that you have a message there is no way to know that you have a message waiting unless you pick up the phone and look.  All my older model cell phones featured a tone and/or a light on the outside of the phone to let you know that you had a message.I have never written a review before on Amazon or otherwise, but I feel that people should be aware that the cool, hip advertising of the RAZR is not what it is cracked up to be.",2,Not what it's cracked up to be,1140220800,"02 18, 2006"

When I first got it, I couldn't wear it for more than 5-10 minutes.  Now that my ear has become accustomed to it, I can wear it for an hour or so.  It just takes getting used to.  However, I wish I could rotate the headset without rotating the earhook like some bluetooth headsets.  In order to have the headset have a tight grip on my ear (and not fall off), I have to rotate the headset so that it points upwards towards my eyebrows instead of downwards towards my mouth.  It's not really an inconvenience per se, but it looks pretty uncool.  Perhaps I have misshapen ears.Audio: The sound is fantastic.  Only sometimes does it get staticky in my pocket, and not often enough to notice, at least on my end.Ease-of-Use:  This headset was easy to pair with my Motorola KRZR and the main things I do (hanging up, answering calls, and adjusting volume) are simple and intuitive.  Only problem is that if you don't hold buttons for the correct length of time, it can perform the wrong function.  For example, pressing the call button once activates voice dialing, for 1 second redials your last call and 3 seconds turns it off.  I've done my share of accidentally redialing.Battery: I was disappointed when I learned the battery wasn't rechargeable and it instead uses a AAA battery, but the lifetime is very long.  It's supposedly 30 hours or so.  I can't verify that, I just know I've been using it for two months now without replacing it, and it's just a regular Energizer battery.Durability: I carry this around in my jacket pocket most of the time and it holds up well.

Because, this does not have a non-removable rechargeable battery like most handsfree headsets.  Instead, it can be operated with a single AAA battery.  I just got it, so I cannot verify the performance of the battery, but knowing that I won't have to throw this away in a couple of years is worth it.  The features include call accept, call deny, mute, hold, voice dialing, 3 way calling, and you can turn off the blinking blue light (if you're so inclined).  Even though it takes a AAA battery, it's about the same size as a comparable rechargeable headset.  It may be 2 mm thicker, but the same length as most.

A2LHL3RYUYLCN8,B000BBCTJ8,"Amazon Customer ""Marty B""","[97, 98]","My last Bluetooth headset, a Cardo Scala 500 featured great sound, wonderful battery life but a poor, floppy fit and very crummy construction. The poor thing literally fell apart after three months.I replaced the Cardo today with a Plantronics Explorer 320 and I'm pretty satisfied. First, recognize that there is no such thing as a perfect all-around headset for all phones and all users. It's pretty important that you buy from a source, like Amazon, where you can try things and return them if not satisfied. EBay may have great prices on stuff, but unless you know you'll like something, I wouldn't suggest buying a BT Headset there... way too hard to return.The Plantronics 320 is a budget version of their upper end headsets, but it is hard to see where they scrimped. The fit and finish of the product is excellent. The power connector is solid and snapped in and charged the unit quickly. It paired up to my Treo 650 on the first try and was identified correctly by name.Using the 320, I made several calls to automated numbers. All connected quickly, except the one where my phone automatically follows a script to punch in passwords. In that call, there was a considerable delay before the 320 took the audio signal from my phone. My old Cardo had the same delay, so I think this is a function of the phone.The fit of the headset is great for me. The unit has a small portion that inserts gently in my ear, and the wrap-around portion holds the device closely to my ear without any pressure or discomfort. I've been wearing it all day and it is light and very comfortable. Your mileage may vary.So what's not perfect? The sound quality isn't quite there. I pick up some static between the device and my Treo and it gets worse when the phone is on the other side of my body or when I move more than five feet away. It's not horrible, but it's there in my setup. Again, your mileage may vary.",4,Great moderately priced BT headset,1130630400,"10 30, 2005"

A3SO8IS08TELUA,B000BBCTJ8,"K. Sanz ""KSanz""","[0, 0]","I have owned this unit about three weeks now. I got this unit at a close out price, and I feel that I definitely got my money's worth. I have never owned a Blue-tooth head set before so I have nothing to compare it to. I read reviews on the Internet and decided that this was the unit I wanted in my price range. The sound is clear and intelligible on both ends,... as far as I can tell, even in the car, which is what I bought it for...(to use while driving)... and it is fairly comfortable for about 2 hours of ware, but after that becomes somewhat uncomfortable. I think with some adjustment it may be possible to make it feel even more comfortable, a lot of comfort depends on your own sensitivity,  ear and head shape. Once paired with my phone, Razr V3, it reconnects each time in a matter of seconds (usually). Only once did it take longer. Before buying this headset I had never hear of Plantronics before, but I would say that their products have a good build quality and good sound. I liked these units more than the  Motorola headsets mostly because of the way they fit rather than any sound quality issue.",5,Great Bluetooth for the Price,1215993600,"07 14, 2008"

I spent a few days researching the various headsets out there, and soon discovered that only a handful appeared to be worth buying -- and all were between $100 and $150, which I did not want to spend. I came across these by accident, and couldn't find any of the negative comments common with headsets in this price range. Granted they're only Bluetooth v1.2, but they're light, have a built-in rechargable battery, are quite comfortable to wear, and have very good sound quality. In addition, the pairing process is quite simple.If your priorities are quality sound, comfort, built-in battery, and reasonable price, these will be hard to beat.

For the past week  I've bought 4 headsets(Motorola 500,850,700,& this one which is one of the worst.I found the Motorola 700 to be the best so far.  Clear reception most of the time,excellent volume(no problem hearing while driving),& it always connected to my treo 650.

A1N5FSCYN4796F,B000BBCTJ8,"Philip R. Heath ""Gadgets, Music, & Books""","[25, 32]","I really wanted this headset to work out because it is being sold at such a good price relative to most others.  Well, it prooved to me that you often get what you pay for.  Let's consider the following in why I am returning this headset: pairing, sound quality, ease of use, and comfort.Pairing - this really belongs with ease of use, but it is really your first experience with a headset other than charging it.  It was hard to figure out if I was holding the multifunction button down long enough to get the headset in paring mode.  After 4 attempts, I got it right.  My LG VX-9800(see my review)was able to pair with it easily after this.  However, it shouldn't take 4 attempts just to get a headset into pairing mode.Sound Quality - this is actually the area where the headset does the best in my opinion.  With the speaker resting inside my ear, I didn't have to have the volume turned all the way up in order to hear the people I called.  My wife reported that she could hear me clearly with one exception.  When I had the AC fan speed in my car set to 3 (out of 4), she said that it sounded like I was in a wind tunnel.  Kicking the AC down to 2 fixed the problem, but once we hit the Texas summer that could be a problem.Ease of Use - I think that Plantronics' attempt to make this headset easy to use backfired.  I would go to turn on the headset, but I would always have to check my phone to see if it was connected.  Initiating voice commands also required multiple attempts before I would hear the familiar ""Please say a command"" from my phone.  However, what really drove me nuts was trying to turn it off.  I would hold down the multifunction button for what I thought was the amount of time specified in the instructions, but I kept getting ""Please say a command"".  Compare this to the Motorola HS850(see my review) where on/off is controlled by the folding boom while the multifunction button simply handles pairing, voice commands, and call connecting.  I consider my self to have technology savvy and able to fight through things to make them work, but this headset *still* frustrated me.  If you like things to work simply, this headset isn't for you.Comfort - I was willing to put up with the flaky operation of the headset because of the cost; however, I realized after two days that I was not going to be able to stand to wear it for any extended period of time.  The speaker pipes its volume into a rather hard earpiece that fits inside your ear.  It is not removable, and try as I might to adjust it, I could not find a comfortable position.  The ear hook is also fairly rigid.  These two things combined made for an unpleasant comfort experience.I have to consider this headset to be a failure.  On the box, it touts ""Comfort"" and ""Ease of Use"".  As you can see from my results, it doesn't deliver on either of these.  It's a shame because it does deliver good sound quality at a reasonable price.  Unless you have the ear it was modeled after, though, I would not buy it.",2,Doesn't Deliver On Its Potential,1143590400,"03 29, 2006"

A2RYO45PFJVLB9,B000BBCTJ8,Samuel Johnson,"[0, 0]","Of the 8 headsets I've tested, this one is about average. The sound quality is slightly muffled. No worse than most of the ones I've tried, but definitely not as good as my favorite, the Plantronics Voyager 510. If you've got a noisy environment, this one probably won't satisfy. I liked the single button function and found it worked great with only a rare glitch when the headset would partially connect to the phone resulting in me being able to hear through the headset but needing to speak through the phone. (Turn off the headset and turn it back on. No need to end the call.) My partner and I both used one of these hard core for over a year in a construction environment until I broke the ear loop on mine and moved on to the 510. Considering what we put them through, I have to say that this unit holds up. I compare headsets by pairing two of them, putting one in each ear and switching between them while on the same call. This lets me and the caller hear the difference. All in all, good price, easy to use, sturdy, and most people won't notice the sound quality.",3,"Easy to use, Sturdy, Not the best sound.",1205020800,"03 9, 2008"

Specially the bass. Most of the ear-bud style headphones suck at reproducing bass. My T-Mobile MDA has paired up perfectly. The A2DP and the volume/play/pause/mute work like charm. I would give it a 5 star but it's a little bulky for the gym. The cloth interior of the speakers will not stand the sweat for long.

It is made of hard plastic with odd fins and protrusions everywhere.  It does not rest easily on the head.  It feels heavy and abrasive.  I am surprised that none of these manufacturers have come up with a softer, lighter material, or spent any time considering how to fit a headset to the ears and head.  Sony does a better job with its DRBT21G/B, but also falls victim to hard plastic and a hinge in the middle of the set that digs at your skull as time goes on.  Truly astonishing.I could not get the unit to pair with my top-of-the-line Sony bluetooth transmitter.  Motorola was ""kind"" enough to issue a stern warning about returning this item without calling their toll-free number.  What a waste of time.

A21LAY2T4KERFL,B000BBE9C8,"Chines ""MagnaRider""","[7, 8]","These headphones are great.  There are a few annoyances that don't make these superb.First, the bad; it is true what others are saying about the comfort.  After prolonged periods of use, they may start to hurt your ears a bit.  Its not unbearable, but more like annoying.  Secondly, they are a little big, but for what they do, its understandable.  WARNING: These headphones will make you look like a tech dork.  But who cares?  They're freaking wireless.Now, with that out of the way, its time for the good parts.  The sound quality is good.  The battery life is long and wonderful(10 to 16 hours).  Charge time is short.  Charging is convenient using the same usb charger as my razr cell phone.  Only need to bring one charger on trips.  The quality is good.  This headphones seem to be constructed well.  Set up is generally easy.  The directions suck, but the only vital info I found to be missing is that ""pairing"" can take up to a minute or so.  The vocal quality is good enough.  My callers can hear me well enough, but they are  aware that I am using some sort of hands free device.Overall, I am very happy with these headphones.  I would recommend these to anyone (as long as you don't mind looking like tech dork).",4,Wires?  What for?,1171670400,"02 17, 2007"
